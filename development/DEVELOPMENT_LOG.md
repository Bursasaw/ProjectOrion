## Bug Tracking

### Current Bugs (v0.1.0)
- **Critical**: 0
- **High**: 0
- **Medium**: 0
- **Low**: 0
- **Total**: 0

### Known Issues
- Save/Load system not yet implemented
- UI systems need development
- Audio and visual assets pending
- World-specific content needs development

#### Bugs and Technical Issues (v0.1.0)
- Global class parse errors due to missing `class_name` declarations in PlayerData and manager scripts.
- Signal/function name conflict in PlayerData.gd (`level_up`).
- Enum/string comparison errors in CombatActor.gd.
- Node-only API (`get_viewport()`) used in GameSettings.gd (a Resource).
- Duplicate UID in MainMenu.tscn and Main.tscn.
- Cascading parse failures due to the above issues.

**Root Causes:**
- Lack of `class_name` for global type registration.
- GDScript restriction on signal/function naming.
- Enum and string type mismatch in comparisons.
- Resource/Node API boundaries not respected.
- Scene UID not unique.

**Planned Fixes:**
- Add `class_name` to all custom classes.
- Rename conflicting signal/function.
- Fix enum comparisons.
- Refactor GameSettings.gd.
- Change duplicate UID.
- Re-test for successful compilation.

#### Additional Bugs and Technical Issues (v0.1.0)
- Too few arguments for `start_combat()` call in GameManager.gd (expected at least 2, got 0).
  - Root Cause: Incorrect function call signature.
  - Impact: Script fails to parse, breaking autoload and combat systems.
  - Planned Fix: Update all calls to `start_combat()` to provide the required arguments.
- UID duplicate warning between MainMenu.tscn and Main.tscn.
  - Root Cause: Scene duplication without UID change.
  - Impact: Resource conflicts and unpredictable scene loading.
  - Planned Fix: Change the UID in one of the `.tscn` files.
- Invalid argument for `use_item()` function: expected `PlayerData`, got `CombatActor`.
  - Root Cause: Type mismatch in function call.
  - Impact: Script fails to parse, breaking item usage in combat.
  - Planned Fix: Ensure correct type is passed to `use_item()` or refactor for flexibility.
- Cascading parse failures due to the above issues.
  - Impact: Project cannot run or be tested.
  - Planned Fix: Resolve all above issues and re-test.
