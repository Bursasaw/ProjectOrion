LANGUAGE

The base language is called "Kaldar." It is spoken by a race of beings who communicate through a series of clicks, hisses, and whistles. Kaldar has a complex grammatical structure, with various forms of declension and conjugation that are used to indicate tense, mood, and aspect.
For example, the verb "to run" might be conjugated differently depending on whether the action is completed, ongoing, or yet to begin. Similarly, nouns might have different forms depending on their gender, number, and case.
Kaldar is written using a series of symbols that are arranged in a grid. Each symbol represents a specific sound, and the grid is read from left to right, top to bottom.
To facilitate communication between different races and species, a universal translator has been developed that can convert Kaldar (and other languages) into a common language that can be understood by all. This language is called "Galactic Standard," and it is taught in schools throughout the galaxy.

TERRA (EARTH)
Terra is unaware of the other worlds and magic, but a small number of individuals on Terra know about them, while the other worlds are aware of Terra's existence.
Lore
Long ago, during the time of the ancient civilizations, Terra was a thriving planet with advanced technology and a vast network of trade and diplomacy with other worlds. However, something happened that caused Terra to become cut off from the rest of the universe.
The exact cause of this isolation is shrouded in mystery, but there are many theories. Some believe that Terra's leaders made a conscious decision to withdraw from the interstellar community, while others think that some catastrophic event may have wiped out much of Terra's population, leaving the planet a shadow of its former self.
Whatever the cause, Terra has remained cut off from the rest of the universe for centuries. While some individuals may have stumbled upon knowledge of the wider galaxy, they have been careful to keep this knowledge hidden, knowing that it would likely upset the delicate balance of power on their planet.
Meanwhile, the other worlds of the universe have continued to evolve and interact with each other, their cultures and technologies evolving in ways that Terra could never have imagined. Over time, many of these worlds have forgotten about Terra altogether, considering it a mere footnote in the annals of galactic history.
But there are those who remember Terra, and who wonder what might have been if things had turned out differently. Some even secretly hope for the day when Terra might rejoin the rest of the universe and take its place among the stars once more.

The Ancients
DESCRIPTION
The ancients were a highly advanced civilization that existed long ago in the universe's history. Their appearance is not entirely clear, as they have not been seen or encountered for thousands of years. Some legends and rumors suggest that they were a very tall and slender race, with elongated features and glowing eyes. Other stories depict them as shrouded in mystery and able to take on any form they desired. However, much of their physical appearance remains a mystery, as they have been gone for so long.
LORE
Long ago, the universe was ruled by a single, powerful civilization that spanned countless worlds. This civilization, known as the Ancients, possessed knowledge and technology far beyond anything seen in the universe today.
The Ancients used their vast knowledge to create new worlds, each with its own unique properties and inhabitants. They also created powerful artifacts and magical objects, which they used to shape the universe according to their will.
But despite their power, the Ancients were not invincible. A great cataclysm befell their civilization, destroying much of what they had built and scattering their knowledge and technology across the universe.
In the aftermath of this cataclysm, the surviving members of the Ancient civilization were forced to scatter across the universe, seeking out new homes and new ways to survive. They carried with them the knowledge and technology of their people, and as they settled on new worlds, they passed this knowledge down to the new inhabitants.
Over time, the knowledge and technology of the Ancients spread across the universe, giving rise to new civilizations and new ways of life. Some of these civilizations sought to preserve the knowledge of the Ancients, while others sought to use it for their own gain.
Despite the passing of time, the legacy of the Ancients lived on. Their artifacts and magical objects were sought after by collectors and adventurers alike, and their knowledge continued to shape the universe in ways both seen and unseen. And although the civilization of the Ancients was gone, their impact on the universe would be felt for eons to come.
The Ancients had long been engaged in a war with an unknown enemy, a force of immense power and darkness that seemed intent on destroying everything the Ancients had built. The Ancients had always managed to fend off their attacks, thanks to their powerful technology and magic.
However, one day, the enemy launched a devastating attack that the Ancients could not repel. The attack was so powerful that it shattered the very fabric of space and time, creating a massive rift in the universe.
The rift caused chaos and destruction on an unimaginable scale, tearing apart entire worlds and shattering entire civilizations. Even the Ancient civilization, with all its knowledge and power, could not withstand the power of the rift.
As the universe was plunged into darkness and chaos, the surviving members of the Ancient civilization realized that their only hope was to flee the universe altogether. They pooled their resources and knowledge, and constructed a powerful vessel capable of traveling between universes.
The surviving Ancients boarded the vessel and fled the universe just as the rift was about to engulf them. They watched as their universe was destroyed, and knew that they would never be able to return.
The Ancients traveled between universes for many years, searching for a new home and a new purpose. They eventually settled on a new world, and began to rebuild their civilization, but they knew that they could never forget the cataclysm that had destroyed their universe, and the unknown enemy that had caused it.
The unknown enemy was a race of beings known as the Void Lords. They were ancient and powerful entities that existed outside the bounds of the universe, beyond space and time itself. The Void Lords were creatures of darkness, and their sole purpose was to consume and destroy everything in their path.
The Ancient civilization first encountered the Void Lords during one of their earliest expeditions beyond their own world. The Ancients had developed powerful technology that allowed them to explore the universe, but they had no idea what they would find out there.
As the Ancients explored further and further from their home world, they encountered strange and dangerous creatures, but nothing could have prepared them for the Void Lords. The Ancients stumbled upon one of the Void Lords' feeding grounds, a place where they consumed entire worlds and civilizations.
The Ancients were horrified by what they saw, and they knew that they had to stop the Void Lords before they destroyed everything the Ancients had built. The Ancients developed powerful weapons and magic to fight the Void Lords, and they engaged them in a massive battle that lasted for centuries.
Despite their best efforts, the Ancients were unable to defeat the Void Lords. The Void Lords were too powerful and too numerous, and they seemed to have an endless supply of minions to throw at the Ancients.
The battle between the Ancients and the Void Lords raged on for centuries, until finally, the Void Lords launched their devastating attack that shattered the fabric of space and time. The Ancients were forced to flee the universe, and the Void Lords remained, still consuming and destroying everything in their path.
The surviving members of the Ancient civilization knew that they could never forget the Void Lords, and they spent their time searching for a way to defeat them once and for all. The Void Lords remained a constant threat, lurking outside the universe, waiting for their chance to strike again.
MYTHOLOGY
Greek Gods could be a part of the ancients, but they are not revered as gods, but rather as members of a house or clan. This house of ancients might have been particularly skilled at manipulating and influencing humans, and they were known for their power in that regard. However, they were not as respected by the other ancients, who saw their abilities as somewhat base and less sophisticated than other forms of power.
You could also expand on this concept by incorporating other mythological figures from different cultures into the mix. For example, you could have a house of ancients who were skilled in the art of magic, drawing inspiration from legends of Merlin or Baba Yaga. Another house might be particularly adept at alchemy or potion-making, drawing inspiration from stories of Hermes Trismegistus or the witches of Macbeth. By including figures from different cultures and traditions, you can create a rich and diverse world that feels unique and original.

HISTORY // THE OBLIVION

One idea could be that the Ancients were at war with a powerful race of interdimensional beings known as the Oblivion. The Oblivion were feared for their ability to consume entire civilizations and erase them from existence, and the Ancients were one of the few races able to withstand their attacks. However, the Oblivion were not completely destroyed, and their remnants still lurk in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to strike again.
Flaws
Oblivion:
•	Positive traits: cunning, patience, perseverance, adaptability
•	Negative traits: manipulative, merciless, selfish, power-hungry
•	Potential flaw: Overconfidence in their own abilities and underestimating their opponents.
The Ancients:
•	Positive traits: wise, just, compassionate, knowledgeable
•	Negative traits: prideful, secretive, unforgiving, rigid
•	Potential flaw: Arrogance and a reluctance to adapt to new situations or ideas.






















Magic and Technology
MAGIC
•	Magic is an innate ability that certain individuals are born with. It can be honed and developed through training, but some people are more naturally gifted than others.
•	There are different types of magic, such as elemental magic (fire, water, air, earth), divination, illusion, and healing.
•	Magic can be channeled through a variety of mediums, such as wands, staves, crystals, or even the user's own body.
•	Using magic can have consequences or a cost, such as physical exhaustion, mental strain, or even shortening the user's lifespan.
•	The use of certain types of magic can be illegal or heavily regulated, such as necromancy or mind control magic.
•	Some magical artifacts, such as potions or talismans, can be used to augment the user's magical abilities or grant them new powers.
Magic is not widely known or understood in the universe, and those who possess it tend to keep it a closely guarded secret. It is not something that is openly discussed or accepted by society at large, and there are often fears and prejudices surrounding it. As a result, magical practitioners often have to be very discreet in their use of magic, and may only reveal their abilities to a select few individuals who they trust.
Personal Magic
Personal magic can vary greatly from person to person, depending on factors such as their natural abilities, upbringing, and experiences. Some people may be naturally talented in certain areas of magic, such as divination or transfiguration, while others may struggle with these skills but excel in others.
In addition, personal magic can be influenced by one's emotions, intentions, and beliefs. For example, a person who is feeling angry or frustrated may have difficulty channeling their magic effectively, while a person who is focused and calm may be able to perform powerful spells with ease.
Another factor that can affect personal magic is one's cultural or ancestral background. Some cultures may have unique magical practices or beliefs that are passed down through generations, and individuals from these cultures may have a natural affinity for these types of magic.
Overall, personal magic is unique to each individual and can be influenced by a variety of factors, including natural abilities, emotions, beliefs, and cultural background.

TECHNOLOGY
•	Technology in this world has advanced to a point where it is almost indistinguishable from magic. It can be used to simulate or even replicate certain magical effects.
•	There are advanced systems of AI and robotics that can mimic human thought and behavior, and even create autonomous entities.
•	Nanotechnology has advanced to a point where it can be used to enhance human abilities, such as strength or endurance, or even cure diseases.
•	Cybernetic implants and prosthetics are common, and can grant the user enhanced senses or other abilities.
•	The use of advanced technology can have negative consequences, such as addiction, loss of privacy, or even physical harm.
•	There are factions that are opposed to the use of certain types of technology, and may even resort to sabotage or terrorism to prevent its proliferation.
MAGICAL ARTIFACTS
•	There are many magical artifacts in this world that are highly sought after, each with their own unique properties and abilities.
•	These artifacts can range from simple trinkets to powerful ancient relics, and can be used to augment the user's magical abilities or grant them new powers.
•	Some of these artifacts require a certain level of magical ability to use, while others can be used by anyone.
•	The acquisition of these artifacts can be the subject of quests or missions, and can lead to fierce competition among individuals or factions.
•	Some artifacts can be dangerous or corrupting, leading to unforeseen consequences for the user or those around them.
CHANNELING MAGIC
•	Magic can be channeled through a variety of means beyond simple training.
•	Certain locations or natural phenomena may have inherent magical properties that can be harnessed, such as standing stones or ley lines.
•	Some individuals may have a natural affinity for a certain type of magic or magical element, allowing them to channel it more easily.
•	The use of certain types of magic may require specific rituals or incantations, and may only be effective during certain times or under certain conditions.
•	The use of certain types of magic may require the user to draw on external sources of power, such as sacrificing a portion of their own life force or tapping into the magical energy of the environment.
REGULATING MAGIC
•	In this world, the use of magic may be heavily regulated or even outlawed in certain areas or under certain circumstances.
•	There may be specialized organizations or government agencies tasked with regulating and monitoring the use of magic, and they may have their own set of laws and regulations.
•	Individuals may be required to obtain a license or permit in order to use magic legally, and may be subject to fines or imprisonment if they violate these laws.
•	The use of certain types of magic may be considered taboo or forbidden, and those who practice them may be viewed as outcasts or even criminals.
•	The regulation of magic may be a contentious issue, with some individuals or groups advocating for more freedom while others advocate for stricter control.
Regulation of Magic
1.	Surveillance: The government or regulatory agency responsible for monitoring magic may use surveillance technology to detect when magic is being used in unauthorized ways. This could include sensors that pick up on magical energy or spells that are cast, or even the use of magical artifacts.
2.	Informants: There may be individuals within the magic community who are willing to report on those who are using magic in unauthorized ways. This could be out of a sense of duty to the community, a desire for personal gain, or fear of reprisal.
3.	Accidents: Magic is a powerful force that can sometimes have unintended consequences. If someone uses magic in a way that causes harm or destruction, they may be caught as a result of the investigation that follows.
4.	Tip-offs: A person may be caught if someone else sees them using magic, or if they brag about their abilities in the wrong company. In this case, it could be a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
5.	Magic-detection devices: It is possible that technology exists in this world that can detect the use of magic, even when it is being used subtly or in a way that is not immediately obvious. This could be a type of scanner or sensor that picks up on magical energy, or something more sophisticated like a DNA test that reveals the presence of magical ability.
DARK MAGIC
Dark magic in our universe is a form of magic that is fueled by negative emotions, such as fear, anger, and hatred. It is called "dark" because it is often associated with evil, corruption, and destruction.
One of the key aspects of dark magic is that it often involves taking shortcuts and using forbidden knowledge to achieve one's goals. Dark magic practitioners are often willing to go to extreme lengths to achieve what they want, even if it means harming others or sacrificing innocent lives.
The use of dark magic can have severe consequences, both for the practitioner and those around them. It can lead to corruption of the user's soul, physical and mental degradation, and even death. Additionally, dark magic often has unpredictable effects and can lead to unintended consequences, such as opening portals to other dimensions or unleashing powerful, malevolent entities.
The Order of the Void is known for practicing dark magic and is often seen as a threat by the other two orders. They believe that their use of dark magic is justified by the power it provides and the knowledge they gain, and are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals, even if it means going against the other orders or the Galactic Council.
MEASURE OF MAGICAL ABILITY
1.	Raw power: This is the most straightforward way to measure magical strength. It refers to the amount of magical energy a person can generate and manipulate. Those who can generate more magical energy are generally considered to be more powerful.
2.	Control: This refers to how well a person can control and direct their magical energy. Someone who can control their energy more precisely and effectively is considered to be stronger than someone who can't.
3.	Knowledge: Knowledge of magic, its laws, and its limitations can give a person an edge over others who may have more raw power but less knowledge.
4.	Special abilities: Some people may have special abilities that make them particularly strong in certain areas of magic. For example, someone who can see the future may be particularly adept at divination magic.
Ultimately, there is no one definitive way to determine who is stronger in magic. It depends on a variety of factors, including the individual's natural aptitude, training, experience, and the specific circumstances in which their magic is being used.
AURUM
There is a substance called "mana" that flows through all living things and is the source of magical power. Mana is a physical substance that can be measured and quantified to determine an individual's strength in magic. The higher the concentration of mana in an individual's body, the stronger their magical abilities.
Mana is most concentrated in the blood, and individuals with high levels of mana are often born into magical families with a history of strong magic. However, it is possible for individuals from non-magical families to possess high levels of mana, and they may discover their abilities through accidental use or by attending a magical school.
The measurement of mana concentration is done through a specialized test using a device called a "mana meter." The mana meter measures the flow of mana through an individual's body, and the results are given in units called "mana points." The higher the mana points, the stronger the individual's magical abilities.
It should be noted, however, that while mana concentration is a useful measure of magical potential, it does not necessarily equate to skill or mastery in the use of magic. An individual with high mana concentration may still require training and practice to fully develop their magical abilities.

MAGIC WITHIN THE THREE ORDERS

The three orders in our universe use a combination of advanced technology and science to wield power. They do not rely on magic as a source of power. The Order of the Aether, for example, uses advanced energy manipulation technology to harness and control the power of the aether, while the Order of the Void relies on dark energy technology to manipulate the negative energy of the void. The Order of the Nexus, on the other hand, uses a combination of advanced technology and psychic abilities to manipulate the fabric of reality itself.
In contrast, magic in our universe is a separate and distinct source of power that is not tied to technology or science. It is a rare and mysterious force that is only accessible to those who have the natural ability to wield it, or who have learned to harness it through study and practice.


TECHNOLOGY

Explanation alongside magic

In this world, technology exists alongside magic. While magic is the primary source of power and innovation, technology has also advanced in its own right, often working in conjunction with magic.
Some examples of technology in this world include:
1.	Airships: Large flying vessels that use both magic and technology to lift off the ground and soar through the sky.
2.	Teleportation devices: Devices that allow for instantaneous transportation over long distances, often using portals or gateways.
3.	Magical communication devices: Similar to smartphones, these devices allow users to communicate with each other across great distances using magic.
4.	Elemental generators: These machines harness the power of the elements to provide energy for cities and other facilities.
5.	Augmented reality devices: Devices that use magic to overlay digital information onto the real world, allowing users to see and interact with virtual objects in real-time.
6.	Bio-engineering: The use of magic and technology to create genetically modified organisms and other biological constructs.
7.	Weaponry: Advanced magical weaponry that can be used in both personal combat and large-scale battles.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WORLDS
Set One
1.	Earth and Gaia: Earth was one of the first planets to discover Gaia and established a mutually beneficial relationship based on trade and cultural exchange. Gaia has a wealth of natural resources that Earth needs, while Earth provides advanced technology and knowledge. However, tensions rose when a group of Earth corporations attempted to exploit Gaia's resources without regard for the planet's delicate ecosystem. This led to protests and acts of sabotage, eventually resulting in a trade embargo. The two planets are now attempting to negotiate a new trade agreement that takes into account the importance of preserving Gaia's environment.
2.	Aurora and Helix: Aurora and Helix have a long-standing alliance dating back to a war against a common enemy, the insectoid race known as the Xalaxians. Aurora provided the bulk of the military forces, while Helix supplied advanced weapons technology. The war lasted for decades and took a heavy toll on both planets, but they emerged victorious. Since then, the two worlds have maintained close ties, with many Aurora citizens settling on Helix and vice versa. However, there is growing tension over Helix's use of drone technology, which Aurora sees as a potential threat to privacy and civil liberties.
3.	Nova and Polaris: Nova and Polaris are bitter rivals who have been engaged in a cold war for centuries. The cause of the conflict is lost to history, but it is said to have started over a territorial dispute. Both planets are similar in terms of size and resources, but their cultures and governments are vastly different. Nova is a technologically advanced society that values efficiency and innovation, while Polaris is a more traditional and hierarchical society that places a high value on honor and tradition. There have been occasional skirmishes and acts of espionage between the two worlds, but for the most part, they have managed to maintain an uneasy peace.
4.	Axiom and Nexus: Axiom and Nexus have a complex relationship that has gone through many phases over the years. They were originally trading partners, with Axiom providing raw materials and Nexus providing finished goods. However, the relationship turned sour when Axiom accused Nexus of stealing its intellectual property. This led to a series of legal battles and trade disputes, culminating in a full-scale economic war that devastated both planets. After years of negotiations, a peace treaty was finally signed, but the scars of the conflict remain.
5.	Elysium and Olympus: Elysium and Olympus are two of the most advanced worlds in the galaxy and have been close allies for generations. They share many cultural and technological similarities, and their leaders often consult with each other on matters of state. However, there is a growing rift between the two worlds over their differing views on the use of artificial intelligence. Elysium sees AI as a tool to improve efficiency and quality of life, while Olympus fears the potential dangers of creating sentient machines. This ideological divide threatens to strain the alliance between the two planets.
Set Two
1.	The magical world of Aurelia has had a long-standing trade agreement with the technologically advanced world of Novar. The wizards of Aurelia have been trading their enchanted artifacts and magical ingredients with the engineers and scientists of Novar for centuries.
2.	The desert planet of Kharuq and the aquatic world of Oceana have been enemies for as long as anyone can remember. The Kharuqian raiders often pillage the coastal towns and cities of Oceana, while the Oceans send their warriors to raid the Kharuqian desert settlements.
3.	The forest world of Ardenia and the space station of Astra have formed a close alliance due to their shared interest in preserving the natural resources of the galaxy. The Ardenians are experts in botany and animal conservation, while the Astrans have developed advanced technologies for recycling and waste management.
4.	The war-torn world of Krynn and the utopian planet of Elysium were once allies until a disagreement over resources caused a rift between them. The Krynnians, who have been ravaged by war for generations, sought refuge on Elysium, but the Elysians, who had carefully managed their resources, could not accommodate the influx of refugees.
5.	The planet of Gaia and the asteroid belt of Minerva have a complex relationship based on the trade of rare minerals. The miners of Minerva extract valuable minerals and ores from the asteroids, which are then sold to the manufacturers and craftsmen of Gaia. However, the miners often clash with the Gaian merchants over prices and trade regulations.

Free Planets Alliance + Galactic Union?
There could be several reasons why the Free Planets Alliance may choose not to join the Galactic Union, despite the potential benefits.
One possibility is that the Free Planets Alliance values its independence and autonomy. They may prefer to maintain their own government and decision-making processes rather than being subsumed under the larger Galactic Union. Additionally, they may have concerns about losing their unique culture and identity if they were to join a larger organization.
Another reason could be political or economic. The Free Planets Alliance may have different trade agreements or alliances with other factions or planets that they don't want to disrupt by joining the Galactic Union. They may also have concerns about being overshadowed or dominated by larger factions within the Union.
Finally, there could be issues with trust and historical tensions between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Union. Perhaps there have been conflicts or disagreements in the past that have made the Free Planets Alliance wary of joining forces with the Union. Or, there could be ideological differences that make it difficult for the two factions to come to an agreement.










The Three Orders
OUTLINE
In this universe, there are a group of individuals known as the Lightbringers. They are similar to the Jedi in that they are skilled in using magic and have a strong sense of justice and upholding the greater good. The Lightbringers are closely tied to the democratic systems that exist across the worlds, working with elected officials to maintain peace and order.
On the other side of the spectrum, there are the Shadowcasters. These individuals are also skilled in using magic, but their focus is on personal gain and power rather than justice and upholding the greater good. The Shadowcasters believe that those with power should use it to further their own interests, regardless of who may be hurt in the process.
The Lightbringers and Shadowcasters have a long history of conflict, with each group believing that their way of life is superior to the other. However, there are also individuals who walk a fine line between the two, using their skills for both good and personal gain. These individuals are often seen as dangerous and unpredictable, and are viewed with suspicion by both sides.
Ultimately, the conflict between the Lightbringers and Shadowcasters is a reflection of the ongoing struggle between selflessness and selfishness, justice and corruption, and the greater good versus personal gain.
There is no set dress code or specific species associated with each of the Orders. Members of the Orders can come from any species, and they wear whatever attire they find appropriate for their mission. However, some members of each Order may choose to wear symbols or colors that represent their affiliation with their respective Order. For example, a member of the Order of the Arcane may wear robes with symbols related to magic, while a member of the Order of the Void may wear dark colors or symbols related to darkness or the void.
MOTIVATION
1.	The Order of Balance: The members of this order are deeply afraid of chaos and disorder. They believe that without balance, the universe would devolve into complete anarchy, and that the only way to maintain order is to exert control over all aspects of reality. This fear drives them to seek power and control at all costs, even if it means sacrificing individual freedoms and liberties. The danger of this fear is that it can lead to authoritarianism and oppression, as the order becomes more focused on maintaining order than on serving the greater good.
2.	The Order of the Void: This order is driven by a fear of death and the unknown. They believe that the universe is a chaotic and dangerous place, and that the only way to protect themselves is to eliminate anything that might pose a threat. This fear can drive the order to commit acts of violence and destruction, as they see it as necessary to preserve their own existence. The danger of this fear is that it can lead to a nihilistic worldview, where life has no value beyond mere survival.
3.	The Order of the Arcane: The members of this order are driven by a fear of ignorance and the unknown. They believe that there is great power in knowledge, and that by unlocking the secrets of the universe they can gain control over their own destiny. However, this fear can also drive them to become obsessed with knowledge and power, leading them to pursue forbidden or dangerous avenues of research. The danger of this fear is that it can lead to a lust for power that overrides ethical concerns, leading to reckless experimentation or even the creation of dangerous technologies.

LORE FOR THE ORDERS
Difference between arcane and balance
The Order of the Balance actually has a different origin and purpose from the Order of the Arcane. While the Order of the Arcane focuses on the study and mastery of magical powers, the Order of the Balance strives to maintain equilibrium in the universe by promoting balance in all aspects of life.
Members of the Order of the Balance believe that imbalance and extremes lead to chaos and destruction, and seek to prevent that by maintaining balance between opposing forces. This includes not only magical forces, but also social, political, and environmental factors.
The Order of the Balance was founded by a group of mystics who witnessed the devastating effects of imbalance and sought to prevent it from happening again. Over time, their teachings and practices were passed down to new generations of members, who continued to uphold their beliefs and maintain balance in the universe.
While some members of the Order of the Arcane may choose to join the Order of the Balance, it is not necessarily because they no longer believe in the cause of the former. It could simply be because they recognize the importance of balance and wish to uphold that as well.
Arcane falling to void
It is possible for members of the Order of the Arcane to fall to the Order of the Void, but it is not a common occurrence. The Order of the Arcane is focused on using their abilities for the greater good and upholding justice, while the Order of the Void seeks power and control above all else. However, if a member of the Order of the Arcane were to become disillusioned with their cause or become corrupted by darkness, they could potentially be swayed to join the Order of the Void. It would be seen as a great tragedy and loss for the Order of the Arcane, as their goal is to prevent such corruption and darkness from taking hold in the world.
Corruption
Members of the Order of the Arcane could be corrupted or swayed by a variety of factors, such as personal gain, desire for power or recognition, or even emotional attachment. The allure of forbidden knowledge or magic that is too powerful to resist could also be a factor. Additionally, the influence of outside forces, such as other organizations or individuals with malicious intentions, could sway members towards the Order of the Void. It's important for the leaders of the Order of the Arcane to remain vigilant and monitor their members closely to prevent such corruption from occurring.


SYMBOLS
1.	Order of the Arcane: The symbol of the order of the arcane is a stylized representation of an ouroboros, a serpent or dragon eating its own tail. This symbolizes the cyclical nature of magic and the continuous process of creation and destruction that it represents. The ouroboros also represents the unity of all things and the interconnectedness of the universe, reflecting the order's belief in the power of magic to bring harmony to the galaxy.
 	 

2.	Order of the Void: The symbol of the order of the void is a black hole, symbolizing the order's focus on the mysteries of the universe and the unknown. The black hole represents the power of the void, which can consume anything and everything, even light itself. It also symbolizes the order's belief in the importance of emptiness and stillness, as these are the qualities that allow for the greatest insights and revelations.
 	 

3.	Order of Balance: The two curved arrows in the symbol of the House of Balance represent the delicate balance between opposing forces in the universe. The arrows are meant to symbolize the idea of constant motion and change, as the balance between light and dark, good and evil, and order and chaos is always in flux. The arrows are curved to show that neither force is entirely dominant over the other, and that the balance can shift in either direction at any time. Additionally, the two arrows could represent the duality of existence, with each arrow representing a different aspect of existence, such as matter and energy, or life and death. The overlapping portion of the arrows represents the unity and interconnectedness of all things, and how every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Overall, the symbol is meant to represent the idea that true balance can only be achieved through constant vigilance and adaptation to changing circumstances. In the center of the arrows is a circular emblem with a dot in the middle, representing unity and balance. The circle is split into two halves, one white and one black, symbolizing the duality of the universe and the need for balance between opposing forces. The dot in the center represents the individual, and their role in maintaining balance between these forces. Overall, the symbol represents the House of Balance's dedication to harmony and balance in all things.

The Council of the Balance is the governing body of the Order, made up of the most knowledgeable and experienced members of the organization. They are responsible for overseeing the actions of the Keepers, and for ensuring that the balance is never tipped in favor of one side or the other.
WEAPONS
Thought Process

The weapons used by each order would likely be different and reflect their philosophy and values. For example, the Order of the Arcane may use enchanted weapons or staves imbued with magical energy, while the Order of the Balance may prefer weapons that can both defend and attack, such as shields that can also be used as weapons.
The Order of the Void, on the other hand, may use weapons that are designed to inflict fear and despair in their enemies, such as a sword that drains the life force of its victims or a staff that unleashes dark energies. These weapons may have an aura of darkness or emit an ominous energy field.
Possibilities

One possible weapon similar to the lightsaber in our universe could be the "Aether Blade". This weapon channels magical energies to create a powerful blade of energy that can slice through almost anything. Unlike lightsabers, the Aether Blade can take on different shapes and sizes depending on the wielder's preference and skill level.
The Aether Blade is activated by the wielder channeling their own magical energies through a specialized hilt. The blade is typically white or light blue in color, but can take on other colors depending on the wielder's aura or emotional state. However, creating an Aether Blade requires significant magical knowledge and control, making it a rare and coveted weapon in the galaxy.
How weapons are made
The weapons are made through a complex process that involves both technology and magic. First, the weapon is designed using advanced computer modeling software that takes into account the user's physical and magical abilities. The weapon is then fabricated using advanced materials such as nanomaterials and exotic alloys, which are infused with magical energy through a process known as enchantment.
The enchantment process involves a skilled magic user imbuing the weapon with magical energy, which is then bound to the physical structure of the weapon using special runes and sigils. The process is delicate and requires precise control over the magical energy, as well as a deep understanding of the weapon's intended purpose and the user's intended fighting style.
Once the weapon is enchanted, it is tested and fine-tuned to ensure that it is balanced, durable, and responsive to the user's commands. The final step is to add any additional features, such as energy blades or ranged capabilities, before the weapon is ready for use in combat.
How to imbue magic
Order of the Arcane
For the Order of the Arcane, they have developed a process of infusing magical energy into specially crafted crystals that can then be incorporated into the weapons. These crystals are harvested from certain rare mineral deposits found on their homeworld and are carefully refined and shaped before the infusion process can begin. The infusion is a complex ritual involving a circle of mages working together to channel their magic into the crystal and imbue it with the desired properties. Once the crystal is charged, it is set into the weapon's hilt or blade, and the weapon is complete.
Order of the Balance
The Order of the Balance, on the other hand, uses a more intuitive approach to imbuing magic into their weapons. They believe that the weapon must be crafted in harmony with the natural world, using materials that resonate with the magic they wish to imbue. This often involves a great deal of experimentation and trial and error, as they seek out just the right combination of materials and enchantments to achieve the desired effect. The magic itself is infused into the weapon during the crafting process, with the smith using their own innate magic to guide the enchantment.
Order of the Void
The Order of the Void has a much darker method of imbuing magic into their weapons. They believe that the only way to truly harness the power of magic is to tap into the dark forces of the universe, and their weapons are crafted using blood magic and sacrifices. The blade of a Void weapon is tempered with the blood of those who oppose the Order, and the enchantment is fueled by the sacrifice of innocent lives. The process is deeply unsettling, and only those who are truly committed to the path of the Void are able to endure it.
History & Differences

The Aether Blade's blade can change shape and size due to the magic infused in it. The user can manipulate the magic to alter the shape and length of the blade to suit their needs. The blade is made of a special metal that is enchanted to be extremely durable and sharp, able to cut through most materials with ease. Additionally, the blade has a unique property where it can emit a powerful energy field, similar to that of a lightsaber, which can be used for both offense and defense.
The history of the Aether Blades dates back to ancient times, where they were created by a group of powerful mages who sought to create a weapon that could harness the power of the aether. The mages spent years researching and experimenting with different materials and enchantments before finally creating the Aether Blade. The weapon quickly became a symbol of power and authority among the mage communities, and it was said that only those who were worthy could wield it.
As time passed, the Aether Blades became rarer and rarer, and their creation was lost to history. However, there are still rumors that some Aether Blades remain hidden away in ancient ruins, waiting for a worthy wielder to claim them. In modern times, there are only a handful of individuals who possess an Aether Blade, and they are highly respected and feared among the different factions and orders.
The creation of the original aether blade by the ancients is a mystery, lost to time. It is believed that they were able to harness the power of the aether, which is a fundamental force of the universe, to imbue a blade with magical properties. The exact method of this process is unknown, but it is speculated that it may have involved complex rituals and incantations.
Worthy Wielders
A worthy wielder of an aether blade is someone who has a deep understanding and mastery of their chosen school of magic, as well as possessing the wisdom and discipline to use the weapon responsibly. They must also have a strong will and be able to resist the temptation of using the blade for selfish or malevolent purposes.
To create their own aether blade, one would need to seek out the ancient knowledge and techniques used by the original creators of the weapons. This knowledge is highly guarded and not readily available to the public. It would require extensive research, study, and possibly even a quest to discover the necessary ingredients and techniques to create an aether blade. Additionally, one would need to have a high level of magical proficiency and skill to imbue the blade with magic and shape it to their will.
Creation of an Aether Blade
To come across the ancient knowledge required to create an Aether blade, one would have to delve into the history and lore of the universe. This knowledge might be found in ancient texts, inscriptions, or even oral traditions passed down from generation to generation.
Studying and researching the creation of an Aether blade would require an understanding of the magical properties of the universe and how they interact with technology. This would involve learning about the ancient civilizations that created the technology and the magical systems that power it.
Once someone has acquired the knowledge, they would need to find the necessary materials to construct the blade. This might include rare metals, gems, or other magical artifacts.
The Aether blade itself is a unique weapon that is infused with magical energy. The blade is typically made from a rare metal that has been imbued with magical properties. The shape of the blade can be customized to the wielder's preferences, and it can even take on different forms, such as a sword, a spear, or a staff.
The blade is said to be incredibly powerful, capable of cutting through almost anything and deflecting magical attacks. However, it can only be wielded by someone who is deemed worthy, as it requires a great deal of skill and strength to control.
The blade is often passed down through generations, with each new wielder having to prove their worthiness to wield it. The history of the blade is shrouded in mystery, with many legends and tales surrounding its creation and the wielders who have used it throughout history.
 	 
 	 

Differences in creation
Order of Chaos
As for the Order of Chaos, they do not use the aether to create their weapons. Instead, they rely on more traditional methods of blacksmithing and enchantment. Their weapons are imbued with chaos magic, which is a volatile and unpredictable form of magic that can cause unpredictable effects.
The process of creating a chaos blade involves imbuing the weapon with the essence of chaos, which can be obtained through various means such as sacrificing living creatures or channeling chaotic energies. This process requires extensive knowledge of chaos magic and a willingness to take risks, as the chaotic energies involved can be dangerous to both the creator and the wielder of the weapon.
Order of the Void
The Order of the Void has a different approach to imbuing their weapons with magic. Instead of using aether, they use dark energy harvested from the void itself. The process of creating their weapons is shrouded in secrecy and only known to the members of the Order.
The Void Blades are made from a special metal alloy that is only found in the void. This metal is extremely rare and difficult to extract, requiring advanced mining technology and specialized equipment. Once the metal is extracted, it is refined and forged into a blade shape using traditional metallurgical techniques.
The next step involves the Void Mages of the Order, who are responsible for imbuing the blade with dark energy. The process involves channeling the dark energy from the void into the metal blade through a complex ritualistic process. The Void Mages use their knowledge of the void and its energies to carefully manipulate the energy flow, imbuing the blade with immense power.
Only a select few members of the Order are deemed worthy of wielding a Void Blade, and they must undergo years of training and initiation to prove themselves. The blades themselves are dark and ominous in appearance, with a black metal blade and intricate engravings of void symbols along the hilt. The blades are said to be incredibly powerful, capable of cutting through almost anything and even disrupting the flow of magic.
Mechanisms
The crystal or other object imbued with magic would be what gives the aether blade its power. The source of these crystals or objects could vary depending on the world and its lore. It could be that they are rare and difficult to find, or perhaps they are guarded by a specific faction or group.
As for whether it is a guarded secret, that would depend on the culture and traditions of the world in question. It could be that the process of imbuing the crystal or object with magic is a closely guarded secret passed down within certain families or factions. Alternatively, it could be a more widely known practice that anyone can learn with the right knowledge and training.
Lore

The Arcane Order values intelligence, wisdom, and a deep understanding of the arcane, and only those who have demonstrated exceptional skill in magic are allowed to wield the blades. They believe that the aether blades are a symbol of their order's power and superiority, and they are fiercely protective of their secrets.
Order of the Balance
Finally, the Order of the Balance sees the aether blades as a symbol of the delicate balance that must be maintained in the universe. Their blades are imbued with both light and dark energies, and they are said to have the power to restore balance where it has been lost. The Balance Order values wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the universe, and only those who have shown an unwavering commitment to the cause of balance are allowed to wield the blades. They believe that the aether blades are a powerful tool for good, but that they must be used with caution and wisdom to avoid upsetting the balance they seek to maintain.
Order of the Void
The Order of the Void, on the other hand, is shrouded in mystery and darkness. They are a secretive order, and very little is known about them or their methods. Their aether blades are said to be imbued with the void itself, and those who wield them are feared and respected throughout the galaxy. The Void Order values power, strength, and an unrelenting will to succeed, and only the most ruthless and determined warriors are allowed to become members.

Galactic Senates/Councils
THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STARS
This is the governing body of the United Stars, a federation of planets that value democracy, cooperation, and freedom. The Senate is composed of representatives from each of the member worlds, and their main goal is to ensure peace and stability across the galaxy. They work to create laws that benefit all member worlds, and they provide support and resources to worlds in need. The Senate is run by a Chancellor, who is elected by the members of the Senate and serves as the leader of the United Stars.
THE COUCNIL OF THE SOVEREIGN WORLDS
This is the governing body of the Council of Sovereign Worlds, an alliance of planets that prioritize sovereignty, independence, and self-determination. The Council is composed of representatives from each of the member worlds, and their main goal is to protect the autonomy of each member world. They work to create laws that respect the cultural and political differences of each world, and they provide support and resources to worlds in need. The Council is run by a High Councilor, who is elected by the members of the Council and serves as the leader of the alliance.
VIEWS ON EACHOTHER
Yes, both factions see each other as the "bad guys" and believe that they are fighting for the greater good. They view the other faction as a threat to their own values and way of life, and believe that their own faction is the only one capable of creating a just and prosperous society. However, there are individuals within each faction who may question the righteousness of their cause, leading to internal conflicts and debates.
THE SPLIT
According to the ancient lore of these worlds, the two factions were once united under a single banner, known as the Grand Alliance. For centuries, they fought side by side against a common enemy, the ancient darkness that threatened to engulf the entire galaxy.
But over time, differences began to emerge between the two factions. The Order of the Arcane believed in a more mystical and spiritual approach to fighting the darkness, relying on their innate connection to the arcane energies of the universe. The Order of the Balance, on the other hand, favored a more pragmatic and strategic approach, using their expertise in technology and military tactics to gain the upper hand.
As the war against the darkness dragged on, these differences grew more pronounced. The Order of the Arcane accused the Order of the Balance of relying too much on technology and losing touch with the spiritual aspects of the battle. The Order of the Balance, meanwhile, accused the Order of the Arcane of being too idealistic and failing to adapt to changing circumstances.
Tensions boiled over when a crucial battle against the darkness went disastrously wrong. The Order of the Arcane blamed the Order of the Balance for relying too much on technology and not enough on their own mystical powers. The Order of the Balance, in turn, accused the Order of the Arcane of being too reckless and not thinking through their actions.
In the aftermath of the battle, the two factions split apart. Each one took with them their own supporters and resources, forming two new factions with their own goals and ideals. The Order of the Arcane became the Mystic Council, focused on preserving the ancient ways of the arcane and exploring its mysteries. The Order of the Balance became the Technocracy, focused on advancing technology and using it to maintain order and security. And so, the Grand Alliance was no more, and a new era of conflict began.
INVOLVEMENT OF THE VOID
The Order of the Void doesn't align with either faction as they see themselves as above such petty conflicts. They view both factions as corrupt and flawed, and seek to bring about a new order that aligns with their ideals. The Order of the Void believes that the only way to achieve true balance in the universe is to wipe the slate clean and start anew, with them as the ones in charge.
The split between the two factions actually played a significant role in the creation of the Order of the Void. As the two factions grew more and more opposed to one another, the Order of the Void saw an opportunity to manipulate the conflict to their advantage. They began to secretly fund and arm both sides, playing them against each other to weaken their power and create chaos.
Eventually, the conflict between the two factions reached a boiling point, and war erupted. The Order of the Void saw this as the perfect opportunity to strike. They unleashed a devastating attack on both factions, wiping out much of their leadership and infrastructure. In the aftermath, the Order of the Void emerged as a major player in the galaxy, using their strength and influence to further their own agenda.

SOURCE
The neighboring planets would be those in the same system or within a few light-years of each other. As for the ships, it would depend on the individual planets and their policies. Some planets may have trade agreements with others and exchange ships for resources or other goods, while others may sell their ships at a market value to any interested party. There may also be private ship manufacturers who sell their ships to anyone who can afford them. Ultimately, it would be up to each planet to determine how they acquire and distribute their ships.
LONG DISTANCE TRAVEL
Traveling at faster-than-light speeds within a short distance would require some sort of advanced propulsion system, such as a warp drive or a hyperspace drive. The specifics of how these drives would work depends on the technology in the universe we're creating, but generally, they allow ships to travel faster than the speed of light by entering another dimension or "shortcutting" through space.
As for calculating a course, ships would likely use sophisticated navigation systems and sensors to detect the position of other ships, planets, and asteroids in their path. They would also have to take into account gravitational forces and other celestial phenomena that could affect their trajectory. In some cases, ships might have to alter course or speed to avoid obstacles in their path.
The process of calculating a course and avoiding obstacles might be called "navigating" or "plotting a course." The exact terminology and technology used would depend on the universe we're creating.
QUANTUM FOLD DRIVE
One possible name for the hyperspace drive could be the "Quantum Fold Drive", which uses a process called "quantum folding" to allow ships to travel faster-than-light through hyperspace.
In terms of navigation terminology, it would depend on the specifics of the universe and the technology being used. For example, in Star Wars, hyperspace jumps are calculated using "navicomputers" and ships travel along predetermined hyperspace lanes. In other universes, such as in the Mass Effect series, ships use "mass relays" to instantly transport between different parts of the galaxy.
The specific terminology and technology used for navigation would depend on the universe's lore and the limitations and capabilities of the technology available in that world.
THE NEXUS DRIVE
One possible name for a hyperspace drive in our universe could be the "Nexus Drive."
The backstory for this drive could be that it was developed by a group of scientists and engineers from various planets who were brought together by the need to explore and colonize new worlds beyond their own star systems. They worked tirelessly to create a new method of travel that would allow them to travel faster and farther than ever before.
The Nexus Drive utilizes a unique method of folding space-time around the ship, creating a bridge between two points in space that would normally be separated by vast distances. The process involves creating a temporary artificial wormhole that the ship can travel through, emerging on the other side at its intended destination.
However, the technology is not without its risks. The intense energy required to create the wormhole can put a strain on the ship's systems and crew, and the exact calculations needed to create the wormhole must be precise to avoid catastrophic consequences. Only highly skilled pilots and navigators are trusted to operate a ship equipped with a Nexus Drive.
Despite the risks, the Nexus Drive has revolutionized space travel and exploration, allowing civilizations to spread out and thrive across the galaxy.
FLUX
We called it "The Flux". The Flux is a mysterious force that permeates throughout the universe and allows for faster-than-light travel between the different rims. It is often harnessed by skilled navigators who can plot a course through it, using special ships called "Flux Drives" to traverse the vast distances between worlds. The Flux is also a source of power for many advanced technologies, including weapons and energy shields.
Flux Routes

Yes, there are Flux routes throughout the different rims that allow for faster travel between star systems. There are also different types of ships used for travel, such as frigates and warships. Some of the Flux routes are publicly known and easily accessible, while others are kept secret and may only be known to certain factions or individuals. In addition, there may be Flux routes that are under the control of particular governments or organizations, with access restricted to those who have been granted permission.

Magical School / Arcanum Sanctum
LORE
The magic school on Terra was founded centuries ago by a group of powerful mages who sought to keep their magical knowledge and abilities hidden from the rest of the world. They believed that the non-magical people of Terra were not ready to understand or accept the existence of magic, and that revealing their powers would only lead to chaos and destruction.
Over time, the school grew in size and reputation, attracting talented young students from all over Terra who were eager to learn the secrets of magic. However, the school also became increasingly insular and paranoid, with the faculty and staff going to great lengths to keep their activities and teachings hidden from outsiders.
Unbeknownst to most of the students and faculty, there was a small group of rogue mages within the school who were using their powers for their own selfish gain. They saw the non-magical people of Terra as beneath them, and believed that their magical abilities gave them the right to rule over them. They used their powers to manipulate and control others, and worked in secret to expand their influence and power.
Despite their efforts to remain hidden, rumors of the magic school and its mysterious powers began to spread throughout Terra and beyond. Some even claimed that there were other worlds where magic was not only accepted, but celebrated and revered.
As the years went by, the rift between the two factions within the school grew deeper, and the fate of Terra hung in the balance. The question remained: would the secrets of magic be kept hidden forever, or would they be revealed to the world with disastrous consequences?

WANDS
In the Arcanum Sanctum, students are taught to create their own wands as a part of their education. Each wand is unique to its creator and is believed to enhance their magical abilities.
To create a wand, students must first find a wandwood that resonates with them. Wandwoods can come from various trees or even magical creatures and are believed to hold specific magical properties. The students then carve and shape the wand, imbuing it with their own personal magic.
As for the magical garden, it is a hidden and protected area within the school grounds. It is said that only those with pure intentions and a deep understanding of nature can find it. The garden is filled with rare and exotic plants that are believed to hold magical properties. Students can learn from the plants and use them in various magical concoctions.
There are also rumors of secret societies that meet in the garden at night. These societies are said to be composed of the most talented and powerful students in the school, and they use their collective knowledge to uncover ancient magical secrets.

In some cultures, magic is believed to be an innate ability that doesn't require the use of wands or any other tools. These individuals are able to channel their magic through their thoughts, emotions, and intentions.
In such cultures, magical education often focuses on developing these innate abilities and learning how to control and refine them. Students may practice meditation, visualization, and other techniques to hone their skills and connect with their inner magic.

Overall, the approach to magic in such cultures is often more intuitive and personal, with a focus on self-discovery and exploration of the individual's unique magical potential.


Imbuing Magic
In the Arcanum Sanctum, students are taught the art of wand making and imbuing their wands with magical power. The students begin by choosing the type of wood they want for their wand, with each type of wood having its own unique properties and characteristics.
Once the student has chosen their wood, they then must go through a process of crafting the wand and infusing it with magical power. This process involves using various magical tools and incantations, and can take several weeks to complete.
Once the wand is imbued with magical power, the student can use it to cast spells and perform magic. However, the strength and effectiveness of the wand depends on the skill and knowledge of the wielder.

There are several that exist within the Arcanum Sanctum. Each society has its own set of beliefs, values, and practices, and only the most dedicated and skilled students are invited to join.

The Animal
How about a majestic creature with a deer-like body and antlers, but with large wings that allow it to fly? Its body could be covered in iridescent feathers that shimmer in a rainbow of bright colors. Its expression could be calm and content, with a slight smile on its face. This way, the animal represents the school's values of wisdom and knowledge (through its deer-like qualities), power and ability (through its wings), and individuality and creativity (through its unique and striking appearance).
A slight smile can convey a sense of calmness, contentment, and friendliness. It could suggest that the animal is approachable, gentle, and kind. Additionally, a slight smile can give the impression that the animal is wise and knowledgeable, which could align with the values and ideals of the school. It could also indicate a playful nature, suggesting that the animal enjoys life and doesn't take things too seriously.

Once they discover the entrance, they must pass a series of magical tests to prove their worth and gain admission.
Magical Families: Yes, there are old magical families on Earth, but they keep their existence secret from the rest of the world. Some of these families are descendants of ancient mystics and shamans, while others are the result of more recent magical bloodlines.
School Buildings: The school is hidden underground, with a series of tunnels and caverns that lead to various chambers and classrooms. The main entrance is a small stone archway hidden beneath a waterfall. Once inside, students find themselves in a large underground atrium, with stone pillars, soaring arches, and a starry ceiling that mimics the night sky.
Classes: There are classes in elemental magic, potion-making, divination, enchantments, and more. There are also practical classes in combat and self-defense, as well as theoretical classes in magical theory and history.

3.	House of Vortexus - specializes in air magic, wind spells, and teleportation magic.
4.	House of Terrae - specializes in earth magic, nature spells, and healing magic.

Each house has its own common room, colors, and animal emblem. The houses are not founded by specific individuals, but rather, they evolve over time as new students are sorted into existing houses based on their personality and values.
The lore of Arcanum Sanctum is steeped in mystery and legend. Some say the school was founded by ancient magicians who were tasked with protecting Earth from dark forces beyond our realm. Others say the school was built by an enigmatic group of sorcerers who sought to preserve the secrets of magic in a world that was rapidly forgetting its mystical roots.
Regardless of its origins, Arcanum Sanctum remains a beacon of magical knowledge and wonder, a place where the brightest and most talented young wizards and witches can hone their skills and prepare for a future of adventure and discovery.
Sorting 
The gargoyles start to speak to the students in their dreams, offering them tasks to complete. These tasks would be related to the values and attributes of each house, and completing them would help the students understand which house they would fit into the best.
For example, the gargoyle of the house of wisdom might give a dream about solving a complex puzzle, while the gargoyle of the house of bravery might give a dream about facing a daunting challenge. After completing these tasks, the gargoyle would reveal the house that best fits the student's personality and talents.
Of course, the students would not be required to join the house that the gargoyle suggested. They would still have the freedom to choose which house they wanted to belong to, but the guidance from the gargoyles would be a helpful tool in making that decision.
Meaning of the Sorting
One possible way to justify students being placed in a house that doesn't align with their personal beliefs is that the dreams sent by the gargoyles are not solely based on a student's existing philosophy, but rather their potential for growth and development. The dreams could test the student's willingness to learn and adapt to new ideas, rather than just confirming what they already know and believe.
In addition, the houses could be less focused on specific philosophies and more on broader values and character traits. For example, one house could be focused on courage and determination, another on creativity and innovation, another on empathy and compassion, and so on. These values could be seen as important in all areas of life, including the use of magic, and students from any background could be recognized for embodying them.
Ultimately, the placement in a house could be seen as a starting point for a student's development and growth, rather than a fixed identity. They could be encouraged to explore different areas of magic and philosophy, and to challenge their own beliefs and assumptions.
Clash of Dreams
If a student is sent dreams by two different gargoyles in two different houses, it can be a bit confusing for the student. However, it is ultimately up to the student to decide which house they want to join. They may need to consider the values and beliefs of each house, as well as their own interests and abilities. The student could also seek advice from trusted teachers or mentors at the school before making their decision. It's important to note that the decision to join a house should be a personal one, and not based on pressure from others. The student should choose the house that feels like the best fit for them.
As for the gargoyle's sorting process, it is indeed very precise and accurate. However, in the rare event that a mistake is made, there are mechanisms in place to reevaluate and potentially adjust a student's placement. The school faculty takes the sorting process very seriously and strives to ensure that each student is in the best possible environment to learn and grow.
As for the mechanisms of the sorting process, the gargoyles that send students dreams are actually quite sophisticated magical constructs, designed specifically for this purpose. They're able to assess a wide range of factors, including a student's innate magical abilities, personality traits, interests, and values, and use that information to determine which house is the best fit for that student.
The process is not infallible, but it's incredibly accurate, with a success rate of over 99%. In the rare cases where a student is placed in a house that doesn't align with their values or potential, the school has resources in place to help them adjust and thrive.

MAGICAL BLOODLINES

In the world we have created, magical bloodlines have become increasingly rare over the centuries, with many families who were once prominent magical bloodlines now being entirely non-magical. However, some families have maintained their magical heritage through selective breeding and intermarriage. These more recent magical bloodlines may not have the same depth of magical knowledge or power as some of the ancient bloodlines, but they are still highly valued within the magical community. The school on Terra (Earth) may specifically seek out students from these more recent magical bloodlines in order to ensure that magical knowledge is not lost entirely.
Creation of new lines
In our fictional universe, new lines of magical families can be created in a number of ways. One possibility is through the interbreeding of magical and non-magical individuals, which can result in the birth of a child with magical abilities. Another possibility is the discovery of latent magical abilities within a non-magical individual, which can be passed down to their descendants. Additionally, some magical families may adopt non-magical children and raise them within their magical traditions, thereby creating new lines of magical families. Finally, it's also possible that new lines of magical families could emerge through the discovery or invention of new forms of magic or through the integration of new magical practices or technologies.
How does this magic come about
In the lore of our universe, magic is an inherent ability that some individuals possess. It is not something that can be taught or learned, but rather a natural gift that some are born with. The source of this magic is unknown, but it is believed to be tied to the life force and energy of the individual. Some magical families may have a stronger genetic predisposition towards magic, which can be passed down through generations, while others may have more sporadic occurrences of magic within their bloodline.
In the lore of our universe, there is no specific physical or measurable indicator of one's magical abilities. While some individuals may have a natural affinity for certain types of magic or demonstrate stronger abilities than others, it is ultimately an intangible and individualistic trait that cannot be quantified or measured in a scientific manner. Instead, it is typically discovered through self-discovery, training, and practice.

LAYOUT 2
How about the Arcanum Sanctum being housed within a massive, ancient library filled with magical tomes and artifacts? The entrance to the school could be hidden within the stacks, accessible only by those who know the secrets of the library.
As for sport facilities, perhaps there could be a large, indoor arena for magical dueling competitions and other sports, surrounded by tiered seating for spectators. There could also be an outdoor area for broomstick flying and other aerial sports.
The classrooms could be spread throughout the library, each one hidden behind a different bookcase or secret door. Some could be large and formal, with rows of desks and a lectern for the professor, while others could be cozy nooks with comfortable chairs and a fireplace.
And since the school is based within a library, it makes sense that the classes would focus heavily on magic related to literature, history, and knowledge.

The Arcanum Sanctum is an ancient school of magic located in a remote mountain range. The school is split into three wings, each specializing in a different aspect of magic: Elemental, Arcane, and Divine.
The Elemental Wing is where students learn how to manipulate the elements - earth, air, fire, and water - to their will. The classrooms in this wing are carved into the rock face of the mountain, with wide windows overlooking the surrounding landscape. Students practice their elemental magic in a large courtyard, where they can create raging storms, towering pillars of flame, and other impressive displays of power.
The Arcane Wing is where students learn about the more esoteric aspects of magic, such as the manipulation of time, space, and reality itself. The classrooms in this wing are located in a series of towers, each connected by a dizzying array of bridges and walkways. Students practice their arcane magic in a specially-designed chamber, where they can experiment with their powers without fear of harming themselves or others.

The school has a large library containing rare and ancient texts, a dueling club where students can practice their combat magic, and a sports field where students can compete in magical games and competitions.
Each of the wings has its own houses, which students are sorted into based on their magical abilities and interests. The Elemental Wing houses are named after the four elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. The Arcane Wing houses are named after constellations: Orion, Cassiopeia, Draco, and Ursa. The Divine Wing houses are named after gods and goddesses: Athena, Thor, Isis, and Apollo.

The school is designed in a way that encourages students to explore and discover new areas, but also allows for easy navigation between classes and facilities. There are multiple staircases and shortcuts throughout the school, and the students are encouraged to discover the quickest and most efficient ways to get to their classes. In case a student is running late, there are magical portraits located throughout the school that can provide directions and even teleport the student to their desired location.
Shortcuts/Secret Passages
Regarding the shortcuts and staircases, some of them may be enchanted, allowing students to travel much faster than normal. For example, a staircase might move or change direction at random intervals, requiring the students to be quick on their feet to navigate it. Some shortcuts may be hidden behind portraits or tapestries, and may require specific passwords or actions to access.
As for the surrounding areas of the school, there could be a small town nearby where students can go to buy snacks or other supplies, but they would have to be careful not to attract too much attention from the locals. There might also be a lake or a forest where students can go to relax and unwind, or to practice their magic in a more natural environment. Perhaps the lake could be enchanted, allowing students to swim or even breathe underwater for short periods of time.
The forest surrounding the school could be home to all manner of magical creatures, some of which might be dangerous if provoked. The forest could also contain hidden ruins or ancient artifacts, providing opportunities for exploration and adventure.
In terms of the special features of these places, the town could have a magical marketplace where students can buy all sorts of rare and exotic items, from enchanted books to potions and rare ingredients. The lake could have its own unique ecosystem, with plants and animals that have adapted to the magical environment. The forest could contain hidden portals to other worlds or dimensions, as well as powerful magical ley lines that could be harnessed for spellcasting.
Overall, the surrounding areas of the school provide opportunities for exploration and adventure, as well as a chance for students to experience magic outside of the confines of the school grounds.

Greater Detail
The teleportation stone is a rare and powerful magical item that allows the user to transport themselves and a small group of people instantly to any location they have previously visited. The stone is activated by speaking the desired destination and holding it tightly in one's hand. The user must have a clear mental image of the location they wish to go to and the stone will transport them there instantly. However, the teleportation stone can only be used a limited number of times before it loses its magical properties and becomes just an ordinary stone.
The phoenix feather quill is an extremely rare magical item that is said to have been created by the powerful phoenixes. The quill is enchanted with a special kind of magic that allows it to never run out of ink, making it perfect for students who are constantly taking notes and writing essays. In addition to its endless ink supply, the phoenix feather quill also has the ability to correct the spelling and grammar of the user's writing as they write, making it a valuable tool for those who struggle with these areas. The quill is said to only choose its owner and is passed down through generations of students who attend Arcanum Sanctum.
ATTENDING
In this universe, students have to physically travel to a special location on a specific day of the year to gain access to Arcanum Sanctum. This location changes every year and is only revealed to potential students a few weeks before the day of the gathering.
On the day of the gathering, the location is transformed into a magical portal that transports the students directly to the school's entrance. The portal is powered by a combination of ancient artifacts and magic, and can only be activated by those who have been invited to attend.
To ensure that the students arrive safely, there are always experienced wizards and witches waiting at the entrance to guide them through the portal and into the school.
The process is carefully monitored to ensure that everyone arrives safely and without incident.
This system ensures that only those who are truly dedicated to their studies at Arcanum Sanctum are able to attend. It also adds an element of mystery and excitement to the start of each school year, as students eagerly anticipate the reveal of the location of the gathering and the subsequent journey to the school.
Location
The students are informed about the location of the portal and how to obtain the artifacts during their orientation at the school. The school provides a guidebook for new students that explains the process in detail, along with a map of the surrounding area to help them find the location of the portal. The guidebook also contains information on the magical artifacts and how to locate them, along with warnings and safety tips for their use.
The artifacts required to activate the portal are scattered throughout the surrounding area, hidden in various locations. They are not easy to find, but they are not rare either. Many of them are everyday objects that have been imbued with magical properties, such as a key that can unlock any door, or a stone that glows in the presence of magic. Students are encouraged to work together to find the artifacts, as some are better suited to certain individuals or houses.
Once all the artifacts have been collected, they must be brought to a central location near the portal. This location is guarded by a group of senior students who verify that all the required artifacts are present and accounted for. Once the artifacts have been verified, the students are allowed to activate the portal by placing the artifacts in a specific pattern on the ground around it. The portal then opens, allowing the students to pass through to Arcanum Sanctum.
Non-Magical Families
For students who were not aware of their magical abilities or did not come from magical families, Arcanum Sanctum has a system in place to detect and notify them. The school has a group of trained individuals known as "Seekers" who actively search for individuals with magical abilities. Seekers can detect magical potential and will visit the individual's home to explain the situation to both the individual and their family.
The Seekers also provide a basic introduction to the world of magic, including the history of the ancient houses, the magical artifacts used in the school, and the basic skills necessary to control and harness magical abilities. Once the individual and their family agree to enroll in Arcanum Sanctum, they are given access to the portal and are transported to the school.
Once at the school, these students are placed in a special "discovery" program, which provides them with additional support and training to catch up with their peers who already had knowledge of their abilities. This program includes a tailored curriculum that focuses on the fundamentals of magic, as well as counseling and support services to help them adjust to their new surroundings.
Seekers
The Seekers, unlike other students and faculty, do not wear any specific uniforms or robes. They are dressed casually, often blending in with the regular students and staff. However, they do wear an emblem on their clothing - an intricate design that symbolizes their role as guardians and protectors of the school.
New students do not have to find an artifact, but they are still tested by the Seekers. During the testing process, the Seekers assess each student's magical aptitude, personality, and strengths. Once the testing is complete, the Seekers assign each student to a House and provide them with a unique artifact that corresponds to their abilities and attributes. This helps the students to better understand their abilities and provides them with a sense of belonging in their House.
Seeker Tests
The seekers have a variety of tests and assessments that they use to determine a student's magical abilities and aptitude. Some of these tests are based on raw magical power, such as measuring the strength of a student's magical aura or testing their ability to cast basic spells. Other tests may be more focused on a student's personality and character, such as their courage, intelligence, creativity, and empathy.
The seekers also consider a student's background and experiences, such as their family history, education, hobbies, and interests. They may ask students to perform certain tasks or demonstrate their skills in different areas, such as potion-making, divination, magical creatures, or dueling.
Overall, the seeker's goal is to get a well-rounded sense of each student's strengths and weaknesses, so that they can place them in the appropriate house and provide them with the support and guidance they need to succeed at Arcanum Sanctum.

It is expected that the seeker would explain to the student and their family about the existence of magic and the need for them to attend Arcanum Sanctum. The seeker would also provide the necessary guidance and training to help the student acquire the skills and knowledge required to succeed in the tests. In cases where the student is completely unaware of magic, the seeker would also introduce them to some basic magical concepts and practices to help them get started. The seeker would work closely with the student to ensure that they are able to complete the tasks within the given time frame. Additionally, the seeker may also provide the student with some additional assistance or resources to help them succeed.
Guidebook
The guide for new students to the magical world could be a book or an almanac that includes information on all aspects of the school and the magical world.
The guide would be given to each new student during the orientation process, which takes place on the day of their arrival at the school. The book would be personalized for each student, including their name and a brief introduction to the magical world.
The guide would include sections on the school itself, including a map of the campus and descriptions of all the buildings, common rooms, and classrooms. It would also include a section on the different houses, detailing the philosophy of each house and what students can expect from each one.
Other sections of the guide could include information on the classes offered at the school, descriptions of magical creatures and plants, tips on using magic responsibly, and advice on navigating the social aspects of being a student in the magical world.
The guide would be written in a clear and easy-to-understand language, with plenty of illustrations and diagrams to help students visualize concepts they may not be familiar with. It would also be updated regularly to ensure that new information and changes to the school were reflected in the guide.
Overall, the guide would serve as an invaluable resource for new students, helping them adjust to their new life in the magical world and providing them with the information they need to succeed in their studies and in their relationships with their fellow students.

Overall, the tapestries and murals within the Arcanum Sanctum serve as an important part of the school's culture and identity, and help to create a sense of community and history within the student body.
Lore
1.	Moving Tapestries: These could depict various magical creatures, scenes from the school's history, or even act as a sort of notice board, displaying important announcements or messages from the school's staff. For example, a moving tapestry could show a dragon soaring through the air, breathing fire, or a scene from a magical battle that took place at the school.
2.	Still Murals: These could be more detailed and represent important moments or people in the school's history. For example, a still mural could depict the founding of the school, with the four founders in the center and scenes from their lives and work surrounding them. Another could depict a famous alumni of the school, perhaps a powerful wizard or witch who went on to do great things in the magical world.
3.	Humorous Murals: These could be more lighthearted and show scenes of the students and staff enjoying themselves, or perhaps magical creatures getting up to mischief. For example, a humorous mural could show a group of students enjoying a game of Quidditch or a magical creature, such as a gnome or house-elf, playing pranks on the students and staff.
4.	Mysterious Murals: These could be more abstract and represent mysterious and powerful magic. For example, a mural could show a swirling vortex of magical energy, with arcane symbols and sigils woven throughout. Or it could depict a powerful magical artifact, such as the school's magical warding stone or a powerful wand that is said to be hidden somewhere within the school.

DULEING

There are five forms of dueling in Arcanum Sanctum, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Students are taught the basics of each form, but as they progress through their years, they are encouraged to specialize in one or two forms that suit their natural abilities and fighting style.
Forms
1.	Elemental Dueling: This form focuses on manipulating the elements to create powerful spells to subdue or defeat opponents. Students who excel in Elemental Dueling have a deep understanding of the properties of each element and can use them in creative and unexpected ways. This form is particularly effective against opponents who rely on physical attacks, but can be weaker against those who specialize in defending against spells.
2.	Arcane Dueling: This form emphasizes quick and precise movements, using spells to attack and defend in rapid succession. It requires great dexterity and agility, and students who excel in Arcane Dueling are known for their fluid and graceful movements. This form is particularly effective against opponents who rely on brute force, but can be weaker against those who specialize in resisting spells.
3.	Dark Dueling: This form involves channeling dark and forbidden magic to overpower opponents. It requires great strength of will and a willingness to use whatever means necessary to win. Students who specialize in Dark Dueling are often feared and avoided by their peers, and are closely monitored by the school staff. This form is particularly effective against opponents who are unprepared for its power, but can be weaker against those who specialize in defending against dark magic.
4.	Light Dueling: This form focuses on using defensive spells and counterattacks to wear down opponents. Students who excel in Light Dueling are patient and strategic, waiting for their opponents to make a mistake before striking back with precise and powerful spells. This form is particularly effective against opponents who are aggressive or reckless, but can be weaker against opponents who specialize in resisting spells.
5.	Shadow Dueling: This form emphasizes stealth and deception, using spells to confuse and mislead opponents. Students who specialize in Shadow Dueling are often sneaky and unpredictable, using their opponents' assumptions against them. This form is particularly effective against opponents who rely on observation and prediction, but can be weaker against opponents who are skilled at reading and reacting to their opponents' movements.












Prophecy
REVISION 1

When the galaxy is shrouded in darkness and despair, And the balance of the force is at its most rare, A hero will rise from humble beginnings, To bring an end to the chaos and all its trappings.
The chosen one, with a pure heart and steadfast will, Will wield the power of the force and never be still. Through trials and tribulations, the hero will endure, And with each step, the force will guide and secure.
With the aid of allies, and the defeat of foes, The chosen one will bring balance to the force, it shows. In the end, the hero's sacrifice will be known, For through their actions, a new era has been sown.
REVISION 2

When the light of the sun is darkened and the moon is no more, a child will be born with the power to bring forth a new dawn. They will walk between the worlds and unite what has been torn asunder. Their heart will be a guide to those who have lost their way, and their hand will be a sword against the darkness. But their true test will come when they face their own shadow, and only then will the fate of the world be decided.
This prophecy can be interpreted in different ways, but it suggests that the chosen one will be born in a time of great chaos and upheaval, and that they will have the power to bring about a new era of peace and unity. However, their journey will not be easy, and they will face many challenges along the way. The reference to the child walking between the worlds could suggest that they have a connection to both the magical and non-magical realms, and that they may be able to bridge the divide between them. The mention of the child's shadow could foreshadow a darker side to their character or a potential turning point in the story.
REVISION 3
Ancient 1: The prophecy speaks of a hero who will rise to bring balance to the force. It has been long-awaited, and its fulfillment could mean the end of chaos or the end of balance.
Ancient 2: But how will we know who this hero is? What if they are already among us?
Ancient 1: The prophecy foretells of a sign. A symbol that will appear when the chosen one reveals themselves.
Ancient 2: And what is this symbol?
Ancient 1: It is said to be a mark of the chosen one's destiny. A mark that can only be seen by those who are attuned to the force.
Ancient 2: But what of those who seek to prevent the chosen one from fulfilling their destiny?
Ancient 1: The prophecy speaks of a great conflict. A battle between light and dark, where the chosen one will play a pivotal role. But the outcome of this conflict is uncertain. The fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance.
Ancient 2: Then we must be vigilant. We must be prepared for the coming of the chosen one, and do all that we can to aid them in their quest for balance.
Ancient 1: Indeed, for the fate of the galaxy rests in their hands.
REVISION 4 W/ SCENE

The two ancient beings stood atop a mountain peak, overlooking the vast expanse of the galaxy. One was tall and slender, with shimmering silver skin and eyes that glowed like stars. The other was shorter and more compact, with skin the color of burnished gold and eyes like pools of liquid fire.
"The time draws near," said the silver being, its voice echoing through the empty air. "The prophecy of the chosen one will soon come to pass."
The golden being nodded gravely. "Indeed. And what of the prophecy itself? Have you seen it?"
The silver being closed its eyes, as if searching for something in the depths of its mind. "Yes, I have. It speaks of a hero who will rise in the darkest hour, when all hope seems lost. This hero will possess great power, but also great humility. They will be guided by the light, yet unafraid to embrace the darkness when necessary. And in the end, they will bring balance to the force."
The golden being considered this for a moment. "A powerful prophecy, to be sure. But what does it truly mean?"
The silver being opened its eyes once more. "It means that the galaxy is on the brink of great change. There will be trials and tribulations, darkness and danger. But in the end, there will be hope. And it will come from an unlikely source."
The golden being smiled. "I see. And who is this chosen one?"
The silver being shook its head. "That, my friend, is not for us to know. The future is always in motion, and even the wisest among us cannot see all ends. But rest assured, when the time comes, the chosen one will reveal themselves. And we must be ready to help them in any way we can."
The two beings stood in silence for a moment, gazing out at the galaxy below. The winds howled around them, as if in anticipation of the coming storm.
"The time is near," said the silver being, its voice barely above a whisper. "We must be prepared."
The golden being nodded. "Yes. The chosen one will need us. And we must be ready to answer the call.
REVISION 5 SCENE W/ PROPHECY

The two ancient beings, the keeper of the Balance and the keeper of the Void, stood on opposite sides of a dimly lit chamber. They had not met in centuries, but they knew that the time had come for them to speak again. The keeper of the Balance spoke first.
"Brother, it has been too long," he said, his voice echoing through the chamber. "What brings you here?"
The keeper of the Void remained silent for a moment before answering. "I have seen a vision," he said, his voice low and grave. "A child has been born, one who will be the chosen one."
"The chosen one?" the keeper of the Balance repeated. "The one who will bring balance to the force?"
The keeper of the Void nodded. "The prophecy speaks of a child born when the light of the sun is darkened and the moon is no more. This child will have the power to unite what has been torn asunder and to be a guide to those who have lost their way. But their true test will come when they face their own shadow, and only then will the fate of the world be decided."
The keeper of the Balance was silent for a moment, considering the implications of the prophecy. "We must find this child," he finally said. "We must train them in the ways of the force and prepare them for the trials that lie ahead."
The keeper of the Void shook his head. "No," he said. "The chosen one must find their own way. We can only guide them, but we cannot interfere."
The keeper of the Balance looked at his brother, his expression troubled. "Are you sure this is wise?" he asked.
The keeper of the Void nodded. "The prophecy is clear," he said. "The fate of the world rests on the shoulders of this child. We must trust in their journey."
The two ancient beings fell into a contemplative silence, each lost in their own thoughts. The fate of the world hung in the balance, and the chosen one was the only hope.
REVISION 6
The Chosen One shall be born as the stars fade, With a power that few can comprehend. They will walk a path that none have laid, And their journey shall be without end.
Their heart will be pure, their spirit strong, With a soul that shines like a bright light. They will right the wrongs that have been done, And lead the lost back into the right.
But with great power comes great responsibility, And challenges that none can foresee. For in the darkest hour, when all seems lost, The Chosen One will rise and pay the cost.
They will face their shadow and emerge victorious, Their triumph a beacon of hope for all. And when the dust has settled and the battle is done, The Chosen One's legacy will live on.
REVISION 7
When the stars align and the veil between worlds is thin, a child will be born with the potential to shape the destiny of all. They will be a harbinger of change, a force of both light and shadow. Their path will be treacherous, their choices pivotal. For only they hold the key to a future unknown. And in their journey, they will uncover truths long buried, and secrets better left undiscovered. But whether their actions lead to salvation or ruin, only time will tell.
This version of the prophecy leaves room for interpretation and uncertainty, allowing for the possibility of unexpected twists and turns in the story.
REVISION 8
When the end of all things draws nigh, a child will be born who wields the power to bring forth a new beginning. They will walk between worlds, and their presence will bring both hope and fear. The Order of Balance and the Order of Arcane will seek to protect them, while the Order of Void will seek to use them for their own gain.
In the hands of the chosen one lies the power to restore balance, but also to destroy all that exists. Their heart will guide them, but their shadow will test them. Only when they face their true nature and rise above it, will the fate of the galaxy be decided.
REVISION 9

When the sun sets on the final day, And darkness reigns without delay, A child shall be born with a heart of gold, And secrets only time will unfold.
With eyes that shine like the morning dew, And a spirit pure, both kind and true, The child will walk the path between, The light and dark, the seen and unseen.
A power untold, a force of fate, The child will hold, in hand and gait, A sword that glows with a radiant flame, And brings new life to the world aflame.
The three orders shall seek to claim, The child for their own gain and fame, One seeks to use, one seeks to guard, One seeks to see the world turn hard.
But when the child stands on the brink, And must face their darkest link, Their heart and soul shall be their guide, And their light shall shine, never to hide.
For in their hands, the power to mend, And bring the world to its final end, A new beginning, a bright new day, The child shall lead the world's new way.
This prophecy hints at the potential for the end of the world, but also suggests the possibility of a new beginning. It includes references to a child with a heart of gold and a sword that brings new life, as well as the three orders seeking to claim the child. It also suggests that the child will have to face their own darkness, and that their heart and soul will guide them. Overall, the prophecy is layered with multiple meanings and potential interpretations, leaving it open to mystery and intrigue.
REVISION 10 W/ SCENE
The two ancients sat in the dimly lit chamber, surrounded by ancient tomes and artifacts. One was tall and lean, with piercing blue eyes and long white hair. The other was short and stout, with a thick beard and deep-set brown eyes. They were both dressed in robes of deep red, adorned with intricate symbols and sigils.
"We must discuss the prophecy," said the tall one, his voice low and measured. "The time is approaching, and we must prepare for what is to come."
The stout one nodded in agreement. "Yes, we cannot afford to be caught off guard. The fate of the universe rests on this prophecy."
The tall one retrieved an old parchment from a nearby shelf, and unrolled it carefully. The writing on the parchment was cryptic, written in a language long forgotten by most.
"When the light of the stars fades to black, and the void consumes all, the chosen one shall appear," the tall one began to recite. "Born of the three, he shall bring forth a new balance, and unite what has been torn asunder."
The stout one listened intently, his brow furrowed in deep thought.
"He shall be the bridge between the light and the dark, and his heart shall guide those who have lost their way," the tall one continued. "But his true test shall be when he faces his own shadow, and only then will the fate of the universe be decided."
The stout one leaned back in his chair, his eyes closed in contemplation. "It is a powerful prophecy, my friend. The Order of the Void will stop at nothing to get their hands on the chosen one."
The tall one nodded gravely. "Yes, we must be vigilant. The Order of Balance and the Order of Arcane will do everything in their power to protect him."
They both sat in silence for a moment, lost in thought.
"We must keep the prophecy a secret, at all costs," said the tall one finally. "If the wrong people were to learn of its existence, it could mean the end of all things."
The stout one nodded in agreement. "We will protect the prophecy with our lives, and ensure that it is passed down only to those we trust."
The tall one carefully rolled up the parchment and placed it back on the shelf. "We must keep our eyes open, and be ready for what is to come. The universe is at a crossroads, and the fate of all things hangs in the balance.
REVISION 11 SCENE W/ PROPHECY

The three leaders of the orders stood in a dimly lit room, each one feeling the weight of the prophecy that had been revealed to them. The leader of the Order of Balance, a tall figure with a stern expression, stepped forward and cleared their throat.
"I have received word of a prophecy that speaks of a child born with the power to bring balance to the force," they said, holding up a scroll. "It speaks of a child who will walk between the worlds and unite what has been torn asunder. Their heart will be a guide to those who have lost their way, and their hand will be a sword against the darkness."
The leader of the Order of the Void, a cloaked figure with piercing eyes, snorted. "Prophecies are nothing but words," they said dismissively. "The only power that matters is the power we hold."
The leader of the Order of Arcane, a wise-looking figure with a flowing white beard, spoke up. "I have heard of this prophecy as well," they said. "It speaks of a child who will bring a new dawn, but also warns of a great darkness that must be faced."
The leader of the Order of Balance continued to read from the scroll. "When the sun sets on the final day, and darkness reigns without delay, a child shall be born with a heart of gold, and secrets only time will unfold."
The leader of the Order of the Void grew increasingly angry. "This prophecy means nothing," they said. "If there is a child with such power, we should take it for ourselves and use it to our advantage."
The leader of the Order of Arcane shook their head. "No," they said firmly. "We must protect the child and ensure that they are guided towards the light. We cannot let the darkness claim them."
The three leaders continued to argue, each one more convinced of their own position than the others. As they argued, the prophecy echoed in their minds, reminding them of what was at stake.
"But when the child stands on the brink, and must face their darkest link, their heart and soul shall be their guide, and their light shall shine, never to hide. For in their hands, the power to mend, and bring the world to its final end, a new beginning, a bright new day, the child shall lead the world's new way."
Eventually, the argument grew too heated and the three leaders parted ways, each one determined to pursue their own path. The prophecy had been revealed, and the stage had been set for the chosen one to come forward and shape the destiny of the galaxy.
REVISION 12 SCENE W/ PROPHECY

The three leaders stood in a circle, facing each other with grim expressions. In the center of their meeting place, a small flame flickered, casting eerie shadows on the stone walls.
"The prophecy has been spoken," the leader of the Order of the Arcane said gravely. "We must prepare for what is to come."
The leader of the Order of Balance nodded solemnly. "Indeed. We must ensure that the child is protected from those who seek to use them for their own gain."
At this, the leader of the Order of the Void snarled. "And who's to say that we shouldn't be the ones to use them? We have the power to control the child's destiny, to shape the world as we see fit!"
The other two leaders recoiled in horror. "You cannot be serious!" the leader of the Order of Arcane exclaimed. "We cannot allow the child to be used as a pawn in your twisted game!"
The leader of the Order of Void sneered. "It is not a game. It is the fate of the galaxy that we are talking about. We must do whatever it takes to ensure that the prophecy is fulfilled in our favor."
The leader of the Order of Balance spoke up, trying to calm the tense situation. "But the prophecy speaks of balance, not dominance. We must work together to protect the child and ensure that the world does not fall into chaos."
The leader of the Order of Arcane nodded in agreement. "The child is the key to the galaxy's future, and we must ensure that they are not corrupted by any one order's ideology."
The leader of the Order of Void scowled. "You speak of balance, but you are the ones who seek to tip the scales in your favor. I will not stand idly by while you manipulate the prophecy for your own gain."
With that, the leader of the Order of Void stormed out of the meeting, leaving the other two leaders to ponder the dire situation ahead.
The two leaders looked at each other, their faces etched with concern. "What are we going to do?" asked the leader of the Order of Arcane. "We can't let the Order of the Void get their hands on the chosen one."
"I know," replied the leader of the Order of Balance. "But how can we protect them when we don't even know who they are or where they'll be born?"
"We have to keep searching," said the leader of the Order of Arcane. "We have to keep looking for any signs or prophecies that might lead us to them."
"But what about the Order of the Void?" asked the leader of the Order of Balance. "They're going to stop at nothing to find the chosen one and use their power for their own gain."
"I know," replied the leader of the Order of Arcane. "We have to be ready to fight them if we have to."
The two leaders fell into a tense silence, both lost in their own thoughts. Finally, the leader of the Order of Balance spoke up. "I fear that our differences may be our downfall," she said. "We cannot let our ideologies get in the way of protecting the chosen one."
The leader of the Order of Arcane nodded, but there was a hint of hesitation in her eyes. "But what if our ideologies clash when it comes to what the chosen one is meant to do?" she asked. "What if one of us believes they are meant to save the world, and the other believes they are meant to destroy it?"
The leader of the Order of Balance shook her head. "We cannot think like that," she said firmly. "We have to trust in the prophecy and in the chosen one. We have to believe that they will make the right choice when the time comes."
"But what if they don't?" asked the leader of the Order of Arcane.
The two leaders fell into a tense silence once again, the weight of their responsibility heavy on their shoulders. They knew that the fate of the world rested in the hands of a child who had not even been born yet, and that their differences threatened to tear them apart at any moment.
REVISION 13 W/ SCENE

The two leaders, Xander and Lyra, stood in silence for a few moments after the Order of the Void's departure. Finally, Lyra spoke up.
"We must protect the child at all costs," she said firmly. "It is our duty as the Order of Balance to ensure that the prophecy is fulfilled and that the child is not used for the wrong purposes."
"I agree," Xander replied, nodding. "But we must also consider the fact that the Order of the Void may have a point. Perhaps the child's power can be harnessed for the greater good."
Lyra's expression hardened. "The greater good? You sound just like them. The prophecy clearly states that the child will bring balance to the force, not serve the interests of one particular order."
"I understand that," Xander said, holding up his hands in a conciliatory gesture. "But we cannot simply ignore the potential benefits of having the child on our side. We must consider all the options."
Lyra shook her head. "I cannot believe you would even suggest such a thing. The Order of Arcane and the Order of Balance were created to maintain equilibrium in the galaxy, not to pursue personal gain."
"And yet, here we are," Xander retorted. "We may have different approaches, but we both believe in the importance of our respective orders. Can't we work together to protect the child and fulfill the prophecy?"
Lyra's lips pressed together in a thin line. "I wish it were that simple, but our ideologies are too different. We cannot compromise on something as important as the prophecy."
Xander sighed heavily. "I suppose we must go our separate ways, then. But know that I will always respect you, Lyra, even if we disagree."
Lyra gave a stiff nod. "And I, you, Xander. But the fate of the child and the galaxy now rests in our hands, and we must do what we believe is right."
With those words, the two leaders parted ways, their differences irreconcilable.
"As much as it pains me to admit it, the three orders were not always so divided," the leader of the Order of Balance spoke with a hint of regret in their voice.
"I remember it well," the leader of the Order of Arcane Fear interjected. "We fought together against the Aether Blades and their dark magic, and we emerged victorious. But at what cost?"
"The cost of victory," the leader of the Order of Balance said solemnly. "The universe was split into three distinct realms, each with its own order to maintain balance and prevent the darkness from taking over. But we were naive to think that such a division could last forever."
"It was necessary at the time," the leader of the Order of Arcane Fear argued. "We couldn't risk another war breaking out, and dividing the universe was the only way to ensure peace."
"But at what cost?" the leader of the Order of Balance repeated. "The very essence of balance is that everything is connected. When we split the universe, we upset that balance. And now, with the prophecy of the chosen one, we risk upsetting it even further."
The argument continued, with neither leader willing to back down. They spoke of their different beliefs and philosophies, and how they saw the role of the chosen one in their respective orders. The divide between them grew wider, until it became clear that they could never agree on the path forward.
And so, with heavy hearts, the two leaders parted ways, each vowing to protect the chosen one in their own way and prevent the universe from falling into darkness once again.
REVISION 14 SCENE /W ANCIENTS & APOLLO

The three leaders of the orders sat in silence for a moment, each lost in their own thoughts. Finally, the leader of the Order of Balance spoke up.
"I cannot help but think of the Ancients," she said softly. "Do you ever wonder what happened to them?"
The leader of the Order of the Void scoffed. "The Ancients were nothing more than myth and legend. They never existed."
The leader of the Order of the Arcane spoke up. "That is not true. There is evidence of their existence in the ancient tomes and texts that we have uncovered."
"Even so," said the leader of the Order of the Void, "what does it matter? They are long gone, and we are here now."
"But we still don't understand what happened to them," said the leader of the Order of Balance. "And why did they disappear so suddenly?"
The leader of the Order of the Arcane leaned forward. "I have a theory. I believe that the Ancients were the ones who split the universe into different realms, each with their own unique properties and laws of physics."
The other two leaders looked at her in surprise.
"But why would they do that?" asked the leader of the Order of Balance.
The leader of the Order of the Arcane shrugged. "Perhaps they were experimenting with the very fabric of reality. Or maybe they were trying to protect us from some unknown danger."
"But what does any of this have to do with the prophecy?" asked the leader of the Order of Balance.
"Perhaps the Ancients knew of the child who was to be born," said the leader of the Order of the Arcane. "Perhaps they knew that their actions would lead to the rise of the Chosen One."
The leader of the Order of Void snorted. "More myths and legends. We should focus on what is tangible, what we can see and touch."
But the other two leaders continued to ponder the mystery of the Ancients, wondering if their disappearance was connected to the fate of the child who was to be born.
//CONT
The two ancients looked at each other, then back at the Protector.
"You have been chosen for a great task," said the first ancient.
"But first, you must understand the gravity of what is at stake," added the second ancient.
The Protector nodded nervously, unsure of what was about to be revealed.
"The fate of the universe rests on the outcome of the prophecy," the first ancient continued.
"And the child who is to be born," the second ancient said, picking up the thread.
The Protector furrowed his brow in confusion. "What child? What prophecy?"
The two ancients shared a knowing glance before turning back to him. "The one we have spoken of. The one who will be born when the sun sets on the final day."
The Protector still looked puzzled. "But what does that mean? Who is this child?"
"That is not for us to know," the first ancient replied.
"But we do know that you are the one chosen to protect and guide this child," added the second ancient.
The Protector's eyes widened. "Me? But I'm just a simple being. How can I be expected to do something so important?"
"Because you are special," the first ancient said, placing a hand on his shoulder. "You have a unique connection to the universe that makes you capable of fulfilling this task."
The second ancient nodded in agreement. "And we will be there to guide you every step of the way."
The Protector felt a mix of fear and awe wash over him. He had never been given such a daunting mission before, but he couldn't deny the sense of purpose it gave him.
"But what do I need to do?" he asked, trying to grasp the enormity of his role.
"You must find the child when they are born," the first ancient said. "And protect them from those who would seek to harm them."
"Those who would seek to use the child for their own purposes," the second added. "And they will come from all corners of the universe, seeking to claim the child as their own."
The Protector nodded slowly, starting to understand the magnitude of what was being asked of him. "And what happens if I fail?"
The two ancients looked at each other gravely. "The consequences would be dire," the first said.
"The universe would be thrown into chaos," the second added. "The prophecy must be fulfilled at all costs."
The Protector took a deep breath, realizing that failure was not an option. He would do everything in his power to protect the child and fulfill the prophecy, no matter the cost.

OVERALL ARC
Book 1

The overall arc for the first book revolves around the journey of the main character, Luke, as he discovers his magical abilities, navigates the challenges of being a new student at Arcanum Sanctum School of Magic, and begins to unravel the mysteries surrounding his destiny as the chosen one.
Beginning: The book starts with Luke, an ordinary 11-year-old boy living with his non-magical family, completely unaware of the existence of magic or his pivotal role in the universe. One day, he receives a mysterious letter inviting him to attend Arcanum Sanctum, and his life takes an unexpected turn. As he embarks on his journey to the magical school, he meets Emily and Apollo, who become his closest friends and allies.
Rising Action: At Arcanum Sanctum, Luke is introduced to the captivating world of magic, encounters awe-inspiring creatures, and starts learning about the diverse orders and their beliefs. He has vivid dreams and visions that hint at a greater destiny awaiting him. As the trio delves into their studies and forms bonds with fellow students, they uncover hints of a dark force lurking in the shadows—the Watcher, who seems to be observing and manipulating events behind the scenes.
Conflict: As Luke's powers grow, so does the presence of the Watcher in his dreams and visions. The students discover ancient records about a shadowy entity, raising concerns about its intentions and connection to Luke. They also encounter red herrings that add to the mystery and challenge their understanding of the prophecy and the true meaning of their destiny.
Climax: The tension escalates when the students stumble upon evidence of the order of chaos's schemes to destabilize the balance of the universe. The group faces a series of trials set by the Keepers, where Luke's potential as the chosen one is revealed to both him and his friends.

Revision 2
Chapter 1: The protagonist, a young student named Alex, discovers he has magical powers and is accepted into the prestigious Arcanum Sanctum, a hidden underground school for magic users on Earth. He's initially overwhelmed by the magical world he's entered, but makes new friends and discovers that the school is divided into three factions: the Order of Balance, the Order of Chaos, and the Third Way.
Chapter 2: Alex learns more about the factions and their beliefs. The Order of Balance believes in using magic for good and maintaining balance in the world.

Chapter 7: Back at the school, Alex and his friends are scolded for their reckless actions.

Chapter 10: The book ends on a cliffhanger, as Alex and his friends make a daring escape from the school and set off into the galaxy, ready to face whatever dangers await them.
Chapter 11 - After the battle, the student is approached by the Order of Balance who invites him to join them.

Foreshadowing:
•	Inn chapter 2, the new student could overhear a conversation between two teachers about a "prophecy" that involves the balance of the universe.
•	In chapter 3, the student could witness strange behavior from members of the Order of Chaos, such as disappearing or reappearing in different places without explanation.
•	In chapter 6, the student could come across a hidden book in the library that hints at the existence of the Ancients and their connection to the three orders.
Red Herrings:
•	In chapter 4, the student meets a seemingly friendly and helpful member of the Order of Balance who offers to show him around the school. This character could turn out to have ulterior motives later in the story.
•	In chapter 7, the student could have a run-in with a group of rebellious students who claim to be fighting against both the Order of Chaos and the Order of Balance. It could be revealed later that this group is actually a front for the Order of Chaos.
•	In chapter 9, the student could discover a mysterious artifact that he thinks is the key to stopping the Order of Chaos. However, it could turn out to be a decoy planted by the Order of Chaos to lead the student astray.
By incorporating these elements, the story can have a good mix of foreshadowing and misdirection to keep the reader engaged and guessing.

Characters of Note
Headmaster/Mistress
Headmistress Aradia Blackwood is the current head of Arcanum Sanctum. She is highly respected and beloved by the students and staff, known for her kind and wise demeanor. However, unknown to everyone except a select few, she is secretly a member of the Order of Chaos, a dangerous group of dark wizards seeking to overthrow the current order of magic.
Blackwood's true allegiance is kept hidden behind a carefully constructed facade of benevolence, but she is always working to further the Order's goals. In the first book, she subtly undermines the main character's efforts to uncover a plot against the school, using her position of authority to manipulate events in the Order's favor.
Despite her nefarious intentions, Blackwood genuinely cares for the students under her care and is known to go to great lengths to protect them from harm. Her dual nature as a kind and caring headmistress and a dangerous agent of chaos adds an extra layer of intrigue and complexity to the story.

THE TEACHER IS THE WATCHER
Potential Red Flags
Perhaps the headmistress could have an unusual fascination with a particular type of magic that is not commonly studied or taught at the school. She could frequently mention this interest in passing, but when questioned further, she becomes evasive or dismissive. This could raise suspicion in the main character, especially if they start to notice odd things happening around the school that seem to be related to this type of magic.
Another option could be that the headmistress is overly protective of certain areas of the school or objects within it, even going so far as to forbid students from entering or touching them. This could also raise suspicion in the main character, who may start to wonder what secrets are being hidden and why they are so important.
Red Herring
One possible red herring could be a seemingly suspicious character who turns out to be innocent. For example, the main character could initially suspect one of their classmates who always seems to be lurking around, listening in on conversations and acting suspiciously. However, it turns out that this character is just a naturally curious and nosy person who is always trying to learn new things.
Another option could be a particular magical creature or object that seems to be causing trouble, but is actually just a coincidence or unrelated to the main plot. For example, there could be a mischievous fairy who is causing minor havoc around the school, but it is eventually discovered that the fairy is just bored and looking for attention, and is not involved in any larger scheme.
The red herring could also be a false clue that initially seems to point towards a certain suspect or situation, but is later revealed to be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding. For example, the main character could find a note or object that seems to implicate a particular character in a sinister plot, but it is later discovered that the note or object was planted there by someone else to mislead the main character.
Foreshadowing
1.	The headmaster/headmistress seems to have a particular interest in the Dark Arts, and their office is adorned with ancient tomes and artifacts related to dark magic.
2.	The headmaster/headmistress often disappears for long periods of time, leaving the school in the hands of a deputy or other member of staff.
3.	The headmaster/headmistress often speaks about the importance of "maintaining order" in the school and seems to be overly concerned with discipline.
4.	There are rumors that the headmaster/headmistress has ties to a secret society or organization outside of the school.
5.	The headmaster/headmistress seems to have a particular interest in the main character, always watching them closely and asking them probing questions.
6.	The headmaster/headmistress is known to have a particular dislike for the Order of Light and often criticizes their methods and beliefs.
7.	There are strange occurrences happening around the school, such as objects moving on their own or strange noises coming from the headmaster/headmistress's office.
Strange Occurrences/Artifacts
1.	Strange occurrences: You can have odd things happening around the school that hint at darker magic being practiced. For example, the main character might notice that sometimes the walls seem to whisper, or that certain areas of the school are always dark no matter how many candles are lit. These occurrences could be subtle enough that they are easily dismissed, but they could still leave the main character with a sense of unease.
2.	Artifacts: There could be certain objects or artifacts within the school that are considered "dark" by those who are knowledgeable about magic. For example, there could be a mysterious tome in the library that is always kept locked away, or a cursed painting in one of the hallways that seems to move when no one is looking. The main character might come across these artifacts and feel uneasy about them, even if they can't quite put their finger on why.
3.	Dreams and visions: The main character could have strange dreams or visions that seem to hint at something sinister happening within the school. For example, they might dream of the headmaster/headmistress performing dark rituals or hear whispers of their true intentions. These dreams could be vivid enough to leave the main character feeling unsettled, but they could also be easily dismissed as just a product of their imagination.
In terms of how the main character knows these occurrences and artifacts are dark without it being too obvious, you could have them pick up on subtle cues like the energy in the room feeling heavy or the air feeling colder around these objects. They might also have a sense of intuition that tells them something isn't right, even if they can't explain why. Additionally, you could have other characters in the story who are more knowledgeable about magic confirm that these things are indeed dark or dangerous, which would add credibility to the main character's suspicions.

Example
The two ancients sat facing each other in a dimly lit room. Their faces were shrouded in shadow, but their eyes glowed with an otherworldly light. One of them began to speak in a deep, rumbling voice.
"Long ago, when the galaxy was still young, there were three orders that held the power to shape the very fabric of reality. The Order of Balance, the Order of Void, and the Order of Arcane were each imbued with the ability to wield the force in ways that few could comprehend."
The other ancient nodded in agreement. "But the balance of power between the orders was fragile. It was said that if one order gained too much influence, the very fabric of reality would be torn apart."
"The prophecy of the chosen one was born out of this fear," the first ancient continued. "It is said that when the galaxy is in its darkest hour, a hero will rise and bring balance to the force. But the prophecy is ambiguous, and it is not clear whether the chosen one will restore balance or bring about its end."
The second ancient leaned forward, his eyes fixed on the first. "But who is the chosen one? And when will they arrive?"
The first ancient sighed heavily. "That is the question that has plagued us for centuries. We have searched the galaxy, but have found no sign of the one who will bring balance. Perhaps they are yet to be born, or perhaps they have been lost to us forever."
The two ancients fell into a contemplative silence, their eyes gazing into the distance as they pondered the mysteries of the galaxy. And so, the prophecy of the chosen one remained a mystery, waiting to be fulfilled by a hero yet to be revealed.
Example Scenes
Max stood outside the entrance of the Arcanum Sanctum, his backpack slung over his shoulder as he watched the other kids hustle and bustle through the gates. He was nervous, unsure of what to expect in his new school, but tried his best to hide it.
Suddenly, a girl with curly brown hair and bright green eyes approached him. "Hey," she said, smiling warmly. "Are you new here?"
Max nodded, relieved that someone had approached him. "Yeah, I'm Max. Just transferred in from the nearby town."
"I'm Lily," she said, extending her hand for a handshake. "Nice to meet you, Max. What do you think of the school so far?"
Max looked around the courtyard, taking in the gothic architecture and towering spires. "It's pretty impressive, I must say," he replied, trying to sound confident.
Lily giggled. "Yeah, it's definitely unique. But trust me, it's not as intimidating as it looks. Once you get to know everyone, it's like one big family."
Max smiled at her words, feeling a little more at ease. "That's good to hear. I'm looking forward to it."
Lily noticed the fatigue in Max's eyes and asked, "Are you tired from the journey here? Do you want to grab something to eat and relax for a bit?"
Max nodded, grateful for the offer. "That sounds great, actually. Where do you recommend we go?"
Lily led Max towards the school's cafeteria, chatting with him along the way. They talked about their favorite subjects, their hobbies, and their hopes for the upcoming school year. Max found himself opening up to Lily, feeling comfortable around her.
As they reached the cafeteria, Max realized that he was happy to have made a new friend on his first day at Arcanum Sanctum. And little did he know, that meeting would change his life forever.

Emily and Luke
The main character's parents were members of an intergalactic organization that protects the universe from evil forces. They were sent on a mission to stop a powerful villain from obtaining a powerful object that could destroy entire galaxies. During the mission, they found an infant who they believed was sent to them as a sign that they should protect him. They brought the baby back to Earth with them and raised him as their own child.
However, they were ambushed and killed by the villain they were fighting against, leaving the main character as the only survivor. He was then rescued by the protector who brought him to Arcadium Sanctum for his protection.
The main character has no memory of his real parents or where he comes from. He only knows that he was adopted by his parents and that they loved him dearly. As he grows up, he begins to feel a sense of longing to discover his true identity and understand why he was sent to Earth. This is one of his main motivations throughout the story.
Meanwhile, Emily's backstory could be that she comes from a family of powerful witches who have been serving the forces of good for generations. Her parents are both accomplished wizards who have taught her everything she knows about magic. Emily feels the weight of her family's legacy on her shoulders and is determined to live up to their expectations. However, she struggles with self-doubt and often feels like she is not good enough.
When Emily and the main character meet at Arcadium Sanctum, they bond over their shared feelings of not belonging and their desire to discover their true identities. They also have a shared sense of humor and enjoy making each other laugh. Their friendship deepens as they support each other through the challenges they face at the school and as they uncover the truth about the prophecy and their role in it.

Perhaps the main character is a descendant of one of the original founders of the Arcadium Sanctum. This could explain why they have a special connection to the magic and why they are integral to fulfilling the prophecy.
However, due to a family feud or other circumstances, the main character's ancestors chose to leave the Sanctum and settle in a different part of the world. As a result, the main character grew up with no knowledge of their magical heritage.
This could lead to an interesting internal conflict for the main character, as they discover their magical abilities and their connection to the Sanctum. They may struggle with feelings of betrayal and confusion, but ultimately come to embrace their destiny and fulfill the prophecy.
It could be that the memories and knowledge of the main character's family were somehow locked away in the ruins of the Ancients' civilization, waiting for the right person to unlock them. Perhaps the main character has some sort of special ability that allows them to access these memories, or maybe they stumble upon an artifact or relic that triggers the memories to resurface.
Alternatively, it could be that the memories and knowledge were deliberately erased or hidden by someone who didn't want the main character's family to know about their true heritage. This could lead to a whole other subplot involving uncovering the truth about their family's past and why it was hidden from them.
In that case, perhaps the main character could have stumbled upon some artifacts or symbols that trigger memories from their past. These memories could be linked to the prophecy and the fate of the magical world, leading the main character to discover their true identity and purpose. This could create an internal conflict as the main character struggles to come to terms with their new reality while keeping it a secret from those around them. Meanwhile, Emily could be drawn to the main character's mysterious behavior and help him navigate this new world, strengthening their bond as friends.

Altheos
Origin and Childhood:
Altheos was born in Celestia, a city famed for its perfect synchronization with celestial energies. However, Altheos, even as a child, was an anomaly. Where others saw peace, he saw suppression; where others saw harmony, he perceived stagnancy. He was a silent rebel, questioning the enforced serenity and the celestial dogmas of Aetheria.
Education and Early Adulthood:
Altheos was educated at the Stellar Academy in Celestia. His exceptional abilities were noticeable but so was his dissidence. He excelled in celestial magic but used it to explore the dark, uncharted realms of the cosmic symphony, bringing him into conflict with his mentors. His expulsion was not due to a lack of skill but the danger his unconventional ideologies posed to Aetheria’s celestial order.
Exile and the Order of the Void:
In exile, the Order of the Void became Altheos’s sanctuary. Here, his theories weren’t heretical but precious. However, the Void was not his spiritual home but a means to an end, a pathway to explore the enigmatic dance of the universe without the restrictions of Aetheria’s dogmatic serenity.
Physical Appearance:
Altheos’s ethereal beauty is an embodiment of the cosmic dichotomy. His eyes, deep and enigmatic, are like black holes absorbing light and truths alike. His physique, though elegant, has an unsettling grace, a dance between celestial order and cosmic chaos.
Ideologies and Beliefs:
Altheos is driven by the ‘Doctrine of the Cosmic Symphony’ – a belief that the universe isn’t a realm of order but a symphony of chaotic, unpredictable energies. He seeks not to control but to understand, not to lead but to unveil the cosmic truths hidden in the silent dance of stars and galaxies.
Relationships and Alliances:
Altheos’s relationships are as complex as his character. He’s not a leader but a seeker, making his alliances transient and purposeful. Each relationship is a step towards cosmic enlightenment, from the soldiers of the Void who are pawns in his celestial dance, to Ethan, who is an enigmatic piece of the cosmic puzzle.
Skills and Abilities:
Altheos’s mastery over celestial magic is unrivaled but unpredictable. Each spell cast, each celestial dance performed is not an act of power but a journey into the enigmatic depths of the universe. His unpredictability isn’t a flaw but a profound connection with the chaotic dance of cosmic energies.
Flaws and Weaknesses:
His ‘Celestial Curse’ is a constant companion. Each insight gained through the celestial dance shortens his lifespan, making each revelation both a blessing and a curse. He’s a man running out of time, making his journey urgent, desperate, and at times, reckless.
Character Arc:
Altheos’s journey is an unraveling of cosmic veils. Each revelation is a destruction of former beliefs, each step forward a realization of the infinite chaos of the universe. In the end, he doesn’t just confront Ethan but his own dogmas, leading to a transcendental awakening where he becomes a part of the cosmic symphony he sought to understand.
Legacy:
Altheos’s legacy isn’t marked by conquests but revelations. He’s remembered not as a commander of the Void but a celestial mystic who danced to the unpredictable rhythms of the universe. He’s not a character defined by victories or defeats but a soul who touched the silent, enigmatic depths of the cosmos.
In Summary:
Altheos is a character of profound complexities, not bound by physical realms but lost in the eternal dance of celestial energies. He’s a mystic, a rebel, and a seeker, whose journey isn’t towards power but enlightenment, not towards conquest but understanding, making his narrative profoundly spiritual and existentially enigmatic. Every action, every decision is a dance of cosmic energies, an exploration of the silent, enigmatic hymns of the universe.
Language and Communication:
Altheos is known for his eloquent and precise manner of speech. He rarely raises his voice, maintaining a calm, soft, yet piercing tone. He possesses an accent that’s a musical blend of his Aetherian origins and the somber tones of the Void, reflecting his internal cosmic dichotomy. Every word is chosen meticulously, embodying a hidden depth and multiple layers of meaning.
Intellectual Prowess:
Altheos’s intelligence isn’t merely academic but existential. His understanding of celestial energies and cosmic rhythms grants him an almost preternatural foresight. He sees patterns where others see chaos, hears melodies where others hear silence. This intelligence isn’t static but an evolving entity, deepening and expanding with every cosmic dance.
Philosophies:
Combat:
Altheos views combat as a celestial dance, a cosmic symphony where every move, every strike, is a note in an enigmatic melody. He believes in the unpredictability of combat and rejects rigid styles and patterns. Each confrontation is an improvisation, a dance of energies where victory lies in harmonious synchronization with the cosmic rhythms.
Life:
To Altheos, life is a transient note in the eternal symphony of the cosmos. He doesn’t cling to life but embraces its ephemeral nature. Every breath, every heartbeat is a step towards the silent depths of the universe, making his existence not a journey of accumulation but of transcendental unveiling.
Political Acumen:
Altheos isn’t a politician but a cosmic mystic. Yet, his insights into the cosmic rhythms grant him a complex understanding of political dynamics. He doesn’t seek power but influences the corridors of power subtly, like the silent notes of a cosmic melody steering the stars. Every political move is not an assertion but an alignment, not a conquest but a harmonious dance with the cosmic energies.
Relational Dynamics:
Altheos doesn’t form relationships but celestial alliances. Every soul is a note in the cosmic symphony, and the confluence of souls is a harmonious melody. To Altheos, relationships aren’t emotional but cosmic, not personal but universal.
Emotional Landscape:
Altheos is often perceived as emotionless, but in reality, he experiences emotions as cosmic waves, ephemeral and transcendent. Joy, sorrow, love, hate - every emotion is a cosmic note, to be experienced, embraced, and then released into the silent depths of the universe.
Attire and Aesthetics:
Altheos’s attire is a visual representation of his cosmic dance. Dark, like the enigmatic void, yet adorned with celestial symbols reflecting the cosmic rhythms. Each piece of attire is not a garment but a note in the visual melody of his existence.
Ideological Evolution:
Altheos’s ideologies are as fluid as the cosmic energies. Every revelation, every dance with the stars, evolves his beliefs. He’s a character of constant transformation, where beliefs are not rigid constructs but evolving entities, silent dances with the cosmic rhythms.
Conclusion:
Altheos is a character where every breath is a cosmic dance, every word a silent melody, and every belief an evolving entity in harmony with the enigmatic rhythms of the universe. He’s not defined by rigid constructs but is an embodiment of the cosmic symphony, a character where every aspect of existence is a silent note in the eternal dance of celestial energies. He’s not a conqueror but a seeker, not a politician but a cosmic mystic, and not an enemy but an enigmatic dance of ephemeral energies in the silent depths of the universe.

General Notes
DIFFERENCES IN DUELING BETWEEN ORDERS AND SCHOOL
A duel in Arcanum Sanctum would differ from a duel between two of the three orders in several ways. Firstly, the use of aether blades in Arcanum Sanctum is more focused on the manipulation of magical energy and the casting of spells, whereas the three orders primarily use their blades as weapons in combat.
The forms of combat between the orders would also differ. The Order of Balance would likely focus on a more balanced approach to combat, with a combination of physical and magical attacks. The Order of Void may rely more on stealth and evasion tactics, using their blades to strike quickly and then disappear. The Order of Arcane may utilize a more aggressive approach, focusing on overwhelming their opponent with powerful spells and attacks.
In terms of dueling etiquette, there may also be differences between Arcanum Sanctum and the three orders. For example, the three orders may have different rules regarding surrender or yielding during a duel, and may also have specific traditions or rituals that they follow before and after a duel.
Overall, while there may be some similarities in the use of aether blades, the dueling styles and approaches of Arcanum Sanctum and the three orders would likely differ significantly.
DUELING ETTIQUETTE
1.	The challenger must issue a formal challenge to the opponent. This is usually done in writing, signed by the challenger and delivered to the opponent.
2.	The opponent has the right to choose the time and place of the duel. The duel must take place within 30 days of the challenge being issued.
3.	Before the duel begins, both parties must bow to each other as a sign of respect.
4.	A neutral third party, called the "Second," is present during the duel. The Second's role is to ensure that the rules of the duel are followed and to act as a mediator if needed.
5.	The duel is fought with aether blades, and the winner is the first to land a hit on their opponent.
6.	The loser of the duel is required to acknowledge their defeat and pay any debts owed to the winner.
7.	If a serious injury occurs during the duel, the Second may call a halt to the proceedings and the injured party may seek medical attention.
8.	Duels are considered private affairs, and only those directly involved and their Seconds are allowed to attend.
In comparison, the etiquette for dueling between members of the three orders in space may differ depending on their specific traditions and beliefs. However, the use of aether blades and the respect for the opponent are likely to be similar.
ORDER MEMBER VS STUDENT?
In that case, if a member of one of the three orders were to visit Arcanum Sanctum and engage in a duel with a member of the school, they would have to use a different weapon. Depending on the specific weapon used, the etiquette of the duel may differ.
For example, if both combatants were using staffs or swords, the basic etiquette of the duel would be similar to that of a typical Arcanum Sanctum duel. However, if one combatant were to use a blaster or other ranged weapon, the etiquette would have to be adapted accordingly.
In addition, the members of the three orders may have their own specific traditions or codes of conduct when it comes to dueling, which may differ from the norms of Arcanum Sanctum. For example, the Order of Balance may prioritize defense and strategic positioning, while the Order of Void may prioritize quick, decisive strikes. The Order of Arcane may incorporate spells and other forms of magic into their dueling sty
HOW A BATTLE WORKS
In a war or a battle, the etiquette of a formal duel would likely be forgotten. The focus would be on survival and victory, rather than honor and tradition.
In a battle involving the Arcanum Sanctum and the three orders, the Arcanum Sanctum wizards and witches would likely rely on their magical abilities to fight, while the members of the three orders would use their aether blades and combat forms.
The Arcanum Sanctum's spellcasting could provide them with advantages such as long-range attacks and defensive spells, while the aether blades and combat forms of the three orders would give them an advantage in close combat.
The outcome of the battle would depend on many factors, including the number of combatants, their skill levels, the terrain, and the strategy employed by each side.
