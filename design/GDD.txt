Theme and setting
Theme: The Dawn of Magic
"Arcanum Origins: Before the Veil" explores the primal and untamed essence of magic at the dawn of its existence, focusing on the pivotal era before magic was governed and structured. This theme delves into the dichotomy between chaos and order, freedom and control, examining how the raw forces of magic can be both a blessing and a curse to those who wield it and those who are subjected to its whims. The narrative probes deep philosophical questions about power, responsibility, and the nature of destiny, encouraging players to reflect on the impact of their choices in a world where every action reverberates through the fabric of magical law and society.
Setting: A Universe of Untamed Arcana
Nokturn, The Shadow Realm: A mysterious and enigmatic dimension where shadows weave the fabric of existence. Nokturn is a nexus of sorts, a crossroads for those daring to travel between worlds or tap into the dark energies that pervade the cosmos. It's a realm where secrets are power, and the unseen forces of magic are most potent. The inhabitants of Nokturn, if any, are adept at manipulating the essence of shadow, using it to cloak their activities from the prying eyes of other realms.
Elysion, The Cradle of the Ancients: This world is a vast archive of ancient wisdom and magic, where the ruins of civilizations long gone still pulse with arcane energy. Elysion is the birthplace of the first magi, beings who deciphered the cosmos's secrets and laid down the foundations of magical governance. The world is fraught with challenges, as ancient guardians protect the knowledge of the ages, offering it only to those who prove themselves worthy.
Sylithar, The Desert of Glass: A radiant and harsh landscape where the ground itself reflects the sky, creating a maze of light and mirage. The magic here is solar-based, drawing power from the relentless sun. The inhabitants have mastered the art of glass magic, crafting items and constructs that harness the sun's energy for life and combat. Sylithar's secrets are hidden in plain sight, protected by the blinding light of day and the treacherous sands that shift endlessly.
Terra, The Primal Heart: A world brimming with life in its most primal and untamed form, Terra is a testament to the raw power of creation. Here, magic and nature are inseparable, and the inhabitants live in symbiosis with the land. Terra's dense jungles, towering mountains, and deep oceans are home to creatures and spirits that embody the essence of elemental magic. It's a world where the balance between growth and decay holds the key to understanding the life force that permeates the universe.
Aethra, The Skybound Archipelago: A world of floating islands and endless skies, where the magic of the air reigns supreme. The people of Aethra have adapted to a life among the clouds, building their homes on suspended landmasses and traveling on the backs of majestic air beasts. Magic here is focused on the manipulation of wind, weather, and the very currents of the air, making Aethra a place of boundless freedom and aerial beauty.
Ombra, The Veiled Depths: A realm shrouded in perpetual twilight, where the magic of dusk and dawn holds sway. Ombra is a world of contrasts, where the fleeting moments between day and night stretch into eternity. The magic of Ombra is subtle yet powerful, dealing with transitions, thresholds, and the blending of light and shadow. Its inhabitants are masters of illusion and transformation, guardians of the secrets that lie in the in-between.
Krynn, The Dragon Dominion: In this world, dragons are not just creatures of legend but the reigning sovereigns, ruling over vast empires where magic is interwoven with the elemental forces of nature. Krynn's landscapes are as varied as its draconic rulers, from fiery volcanoes serving as homes to fire dragons to deep, crystal-clear lakes housing their water counterparts. Magic here is a force of raw power, often manifesting through elemental manipulation and draconic pacts. The inhabitants, a mix of various races, live under the protection and dominion of these mighty beings, learning to harness the elemental magic that permeates their world.
Tauron, The Nexus of Flesh and Machine: A world where the boundaries between organic and synthetic life blur, Tauron is a testament to the advanced civilizations that once sought to transcend their mortal coils through technology. Here, the residents have integrated magic with technology to create a society where organic and mechanical not only coexist but are interdependent. The magic of Tauron involves the animation and enchantment of machinery, as well as the enhancement of organic beings, creating a unique ecosystem of cyborg entities and living machines. The landscape is dotted with towering cities of steel and glass, surrounded by lush, genetically engineered forests.
Aelria, The Realm of Manifested Will: In Aelria, the fabric of reality responds to the collective will and imagination of its inhabitants. This world is a canvas for the most potent sorcerers and dreamers, where cities float in the sky, not by technology or elemental magic, but simply because it is willed so. The magic of Aelria is one of creation and manipulation, bound only by the imagination and strength of will of its users. Here, the impossible becomes possible, and the landscape is ever-changing, reflecting the desires and fears of its people.
Multiverse Lore:
The multiverse serves as a canvas for the exploration of magic's infinite expressions. Each world is connected by the Veil, a thin membrane of reality that seekers of magic can traverse, discovering the diverse ways in which magic manifests and influences life and civilization across the universe.
Multiverse Dynamics
These worlds are connected through the Veil, a metaphysical boundary that separates and unites the myriad dimensions of magic. The Veil's nature is as enigmatic as the realms it envelops, and its manipulation or traversal requires mastery of the arcane.
As a seeker of truth and power in "Arcanum Origins: Before the Veil," your journey across these worlds will reveal the multifaceted nature of magic. From the shadowy corridors of Nokturn to the vibrant life force of Terra, each realm offers unique challenges, allies, and enemies. The decisions you make will not only shape your destiny but also the future of magic across the multiverse.
Cultural and Societal Impact:
In each world, societies have evolved around the unique aspects of their native magic. From the druidic circles of Veridia, worshipping the life-giving force of nature, to the technomancer societies of Sylithar, harnessing solar energies for advancement—magic shapes politics, religion, and daily life. The game explores how different cultures perceive and interact with magic, setting the stage for a rich narrative of conflict, alliance, and discovery.
The Dawn of Governance:
The backdrop to the adventure is a universe at a tipping point, where the unbridled forces of magic begin to threaten the fabric of reality itself. Players will encounter factions and individuals who seek to establish the first universal laws of magic, sparking debates and conflicts over freedom, safety, and the future of arcane power.
"Arcanum Origins: Before the Veil" invites players to witness the birth of a magically interconnected universe, challenging them to leave their mark on a world where the destiny of magic and the fate of its many worlds hang in the balance.
Story
BACKSTORY
In the boundless expanse of the multiverse, where worlds float like islands in the sea of creation, magic was as diverse as the stars themselves. But there was a time, a forgotten epoch, when the fabric of reality trembled on the brink of unraveling, threatened by the unbridled forces of arcane power. This era, known only to a few, was the dawn of "Arcanum Origins: Before the Veil."
The Forgotten Epoch
Long before the Veil was woven, a boundary to separate and safeguard the myriad realms of magic, there existed a primordial harmony. Magic flowed freely, its essence touching every corner of existence. However, this harmony was fragile, threatened by entities and forces that sought to dominate and reshape the multiverse according to their will.
The Catalyst of Change
The world of Aelria, where reality yielded to the desires of its inhabitants, became the epicenter of a cataclysmic event. A consortium of the realm's most powerful sorcerers, driven by ambition and hubris, attempted to create a nexus of power that would allow them to access the raw energies of the multiverse. Their experiment, fueled by the collective will and magic of a thousand minds, breached the boundaries between worlds, creating rifts in the fabric of reality.
The Emergence of the Veil
The consequences were immediate and devastating. Energies from the void beyond reality poured in, threatening to consume the multiverse in chaos. It was then that the ancient dragons of Krynn, the techno-mages of Tauron, and the guardians of Elysion came together, forming an unlikely alliance. Recognizing the threat to all existence, they combined their powers to create the Veil, a protective barrier that would prevent such calamities by regulating the flow of magic between worlds.
The Legacy of the Seekers
In the aftermath, the need for individuals who could navigate the complexities of this new multiversal order became apparent. The Seekers were born—beings adept at traversing the Veil, mediating conflicts, and ensuring the balance of magic across the realms. They were scholars, warriors, and diplomats, chosen from all worlds for their wisdom and courage.
The Heart of the Story
"Arcanum Origins: Before the Veil" follows the journey of a young Seeker, the player character, who uncovers fragments of this forgotten epoch. Driven by visions and whispers from the Veil itself, the Seeker embarks on a quest across the worlds of Nokturn, Elysion, Sylithar, Terra, Aethra, Ombra, Krynn, Tauron, and Aelria. Each realm holds a piece of the puzzle, revealing the true nature of the Veil, the ancient alliance that forged it, and the looming threat that seeks to tear it apart once more.
The Echoes of the Past
As the Seeker, players will navigate the delicate politics of dragon courts, delve into the ruins of ancient techno-magical civilizations, and explore realms where the very fabric of reality bends to the will of its inhabitants. They will confront the remnants of the consortium that nearly doomed the multiverse, now seeking to harness the breaches they once created for their own ends.
The Call to Adventure
"Arcanum Origins: Before the Veil" is not just a journey through worlds but a quest to shape the future of the multiverse. The player's decisions will determine the fate of the Veil, the balance of magic, and the destiny of all realms. In a universe where the past is key to the future, the legacy of the Seeker will either be the salvation of the multiverse or the catalyst for its unraveling.
KEY PLOT ELEMENTS
1. The Awakening of the Seeker
•	Inciting Incident: The game begins with the player experiencing a series of mysterious visions, hinting at a growing imbalance within the Veil. These visions lead the Seeker to discover an ancient artifact linked to the origins of the Veil, setting them on a path to uncover the truths of the forgotten epoch.
2. The Rifts Between Worlds
•	Major Plot Point: As the story unfolds, the Seeker encounters rifts in the Veil that threaten the stability of the multiverse. Investigating these rifts reveals they are not natural phenomena but the result of a dark force seeking to harness their power for its own ends. The Seeker must navigate the politics and dangers of each world to close these rifts and protect the realms.
3. The Alliance of the Ancients
•	Character Development: The Seeker learns of the ancient alliance between the dragons of Krynn, the techno-mages of Tauron, and the guardians of Elysion that first created the Veil. Rekindling this alliance becomes a crucial objective, requiring the Seeker to earn the trust and support of these powerful entities and their worlds.
4. The Legacy of Aelria
•	Plot Twist: The Seeker's journey leads them to Aelria, where they uncover the truth about the cataclysmic event that necessitated the creation of the Veil. Here, they face a moral dilemma when they learn that the consortium responsible for the event was not entirely malevolent and that their actions were driven by a desire to free the multiverse from an even greater, unseen threat.
5. The Shadows of Nokturn
•	Dark Revelation: In the realm of shadows, the Seeker encounters the Nameless, beings who have existed since before the Veil's creation. The Nameless reveal that the current disturbances are merely symptoms of a deeper, more ancient malady—a force that seeks not just to control the Veil but to consume the essence of magic itself.
6. The Quest for the Nexus Keys
•	Adventure and Exploration: To strengthen the Veil and counter the emerging threat, the Seeker must gather the Nexus Keys, artifacts scattered across the worlds that, when united, have the power to repair and reinforce the Veil's fabric. This quest takes the Seeker to the farthest reaches of the multiverse, from the floating islands of Aethra to the twilight realm of Ombra.
7. The Eclipse of Terra
•	Climactic Confrontation: The campaign against the dark force culminates on Terra, where the final Nexus Key is hidden. Here, the Seeker rallies the allies they've made across the multiverse for a stand against the entity behind the rifts. The battle not only tests the Seeker's strength and resolve but also the bonds they've forged with the worlds and characters they've encountered.
8. The Rebirth of the Veil
•	Resolution: With the Nexus Keys assembled and the dark force vanquished, the Seeker and their allies perform a ritual to seal the rifts and reinforce the Veil. This act does not just restore balance but also transforms the Veil, evolving it into a living entity that can protect the multiverse with greater autonomy. The Seeker's role in this transformation marks them as a pivotal figure in the annals of the multiverse.
9. The Legacy Continues
•	Epilogue and Future Quests: In the aftermath, the Seeker is faced with a choice: return to a life before their journey began or embrace their role as a guardian of the multiverse. The game concludes with hints at future adventures and challenges, setting the stage for potential expansions or sequels.
Characters
ARIUS / MC / THE SEEKER
Arius, the Seeker
•	Origin: Born under the rare celestial alignment in Terra, Arius was always attuned to the Veil's whispers. Orphaned in a conflict fueled by dark magic, Arius was raised by the Order of the Nexus, an ancient sect dedicated to maintaining balance across the multiverse.
•	Motivation: Driven by visions of the Veil's fractures and a deep-seated desire to prevent the chaos that once claimed his family, Arius seeks to mend the breaches, uncovering truths that challenge his beliefs about magic, power, and his destiny.
Arius's Expanded Backstory
Early Years and Training:
•	A Unique Birth: Arius was born during a convergence of celestial bodies, a phenomenon prophesied to herald the arrival of a being capable of navigating the complexities of the Veil. His birth, under this rare alignment, imbued him with an innate connection to the Veil, making him sensitive to its fluctuations and tears.
•	Orphaned and Raised by the Order: The conflict that orphaned Arius was no mere skirmish but a calculated strike by a shadowy faction aiming to destabilize the multiverse by targeting those aligned with the Veil's prophecy. The Order of the Nexus, understanding the significance of his survival, took him in, raising him not just as a ward but as a symbol of hope and balance.
The Path to Corruption:
•	A Mission Gone Wrong: As Arius grew, so did his abilities and his determination to protect the Veil. Sent on a crucial mission to investigate anomalies within the Veil, Arius vanished, his fate unknown. Rumors emerged of his fall, corrupted by the very forces he sought to combat, turning against the Order and the multiverse.
•	The Truth Behind the Shadows: Unbeknownst to many, Arius's disappearance was a strategic move. He had discovered a looming threat far greater than the rifts tearing through the Veil—a primordial entity seeking not just dominion but the annihilation of the multiverse's fabric. Understanding the need for preparation and the gathering of unconventional allies, Arius chose exile, diving into the darkest corners of the multiverse to seek knowledge and power that could turn the tide against the impending doom.
The Return and the Fight for Redemption:
•	A Universe Changed: Arius returned to a multiverse wary of his motives and questioning his allegiance. Old allies viewed him with suspicion, and whispers of his supposed fall had sown seeds of doubt. Yet, Arius, bearing the weight of his unseen battle, sought to rally forces against the true threat, his actions often misunderstood, painting him as a figure of contention.
•	The Revelation: In the climax, as the forces of the multiverse stand divided, the true extent of Arius's sacrifice and the nature of his quest come to light. His journey through the shadows, the alliances forged with beings of power and entities once considered adversaries, were all part of a grand strategy to fortify the multiverse against the primordial entity.
The Legacy of Arius:
•	A Universe Forged Anew: With the revelation of Arius's true mission, the multiverse unites, leading to an epic confrontation where the fabric of reality itself is at stake. Arius's strategy, combining the diverse magics and technologies of the multiverse, channels the collective power against the entity, sealing it away and reinforcing the Veil.
•	The Seeker's Sacrifice: In the aftermath, Arius is not the same. His connection to the Veil has deepened, making him a guardian between worlds, but at the cost of never truly belonging to any. His legacy is one of unity, sacrifice, and the understanding that sometimes, the greatest heroes are those who walk in the shadows, shaping the fate of the universe from afar.
