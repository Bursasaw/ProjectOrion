4. **Void Surface**: Reality distortions, probability changes
5. **Water Surface**: +25% healing, +25% lightning damage
6. **Earth Surface**: +25% defense, +25% earth damage

### Surface Interactions
Surfaces can interact with each other:
- Fire + Ice = Steam (reduces visibility)
- Lightning + Water = Electrified water (chain damage)
- Void + Any = Reality distortion (random effects)

## Cover System

### Concept
Tactical positioning provides defensive bonuses and strategic advantages.

### Implementation
- **File**: `scripts/core/CoverManager.gd` (274 lines)

1. **Rock Cover**: +25% defense, -10% accuracy
2. **Barrier Cover**: +40% defense, -20% accuracy
3. **Magical Cover**: +30% magic defense, +10% magic attack
4. **Environmental Cover**: World-specific bonuses

### Cover Interactions
Cover can interact with surfaces:
- Rock + Fire = Heated rock (damage over time)
- Barrier + Lightning = Electrified barrier (chain damage)
- Magical + Void = Reality distortion (random effects)
