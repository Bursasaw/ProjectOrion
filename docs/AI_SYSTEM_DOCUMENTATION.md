### Personality Types
```gdscript
enum AI_Personality {
    AGGRESSIVE,    # Prioritizes damage and offensive actions
    DEFENSIVE,     # Prioritizes survival and defensive actions
    STRATEGIC,     # Balances offense/defense with tactical thinking
    SUPPORT,       # Focuses on team support and healing
    ADAPTIVE       # Changes behavior based on situation
}
```

### Emotional States
```gdscript
enum EmotionalState {
    CALM,          # Balanced state
    DETERMINED,    # Focused and resolute
    FEARFUL,       # Defensive and cautious
    ANGRY,         # Aggressive and reckless
    DESPERATE,     # High risk, high reward
    CONFIDENT      # Optimistic and bold
}
```

### Decision Weights
The AI uses weighted decision making:

### Emotional Modifiers
Each emotional state affects combat performance:
- **Desperate**: +50% critical chance, -30% defense
- **Fearful**: +30% speed, -20% attack
- **Angry**: +40% attack, -30% magic defense
- **Confident**: +20% accuracy, +30% critical chance
