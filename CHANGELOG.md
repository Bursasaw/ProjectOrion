  - Uses `crypto.hmac_digest()` for integrity checks (this API works correctly)
  - Maintains structured data format with timestamps and algorithm info
  - Preserves all existing save/load functionality without encryption complexity
- **Save System**: Now uses reliable encoding instead of problematic encryption
  - Data is encoded in base64 with HMAC-SHA256 integrity protection
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing save files
