# Multi-Agent Task Distribution System

## Overview

The Multi-Agent Task Distribution System allows you to run multiple AI instances simultaneously, each working on different aspects of Project Orion autonomously. This system is designed to maximize development efficiency by parallelizing work across different domains of your game project.

## How It Works

### Architecture
- **TaskAgent**: Individual AI agent that works on a specific task list
- **MultiAgentCoordinator**: Manages multiple agents and their coordination
- **Task Lists**: Pre-defined sets of tasks for different development areas
- **Autonomous Operation**: Each agent works independently for hours on end

### Agent Types

1. **Core Systems Agent** (`core_systems`)
   - Focus: Skill trees, class specializations, progression systems
   - Priority: High
   - Estimated Duration: 4 hours
   - Tasks: Code implementation, system design, testing

2. **Item Systems Agent** (`item_systems`)
   - Focus: Item creation, crafting systems, equipment
   - Priority: Medium
   - Estimated Duration: 3 hours
   - Tasks: Item implementation, crafting mechanics, content creation

3. **World Systems Agent** (`world_systems`)
   - Focus: World persistence, quests, NPC interactions
   - Priority: Medium
   - Estimated Duration: 5 hours
   - Tasks: World state management, quest implementation, NPC systems

4. **Performance Agent** (`performance`)
   - Focus: Optimization, bug fixes, polish
   - Priority: Low
   - Estimated Duration: 2 hours
   - Tasks: Performance optimization, bug fixing, UI polish

5. **Content Creation Agent** (`content_creation`)
   - Focus: Game content like items, quests, characters
   - Priority: Medium
   - Estimated Duration: 6 hours
   - Tasks: Content generation, story elements, asset creation

6. **Testing Agent** (`testing`)
   - Focus: Comprehensive testing and validation
   - Priority: High
   - Estimated Duration: 2 hours
   - Tasks: Test execution, validation, quality assurance

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start all agents
python start_multi_agents.py

# Start specific agents
python start_multi_agents.py --agents core_systems item_systems

# Monitor progress in real-time
python start_multi_agents.py --monitor

# Check current status
python start_multi_agents.py --status

# Stop all agents
python start_multi_agents.py --stop
```

### Configuration

The system uses `multi_agent_config.json` for configuration:

```json
{
  "project_path": "/path/to/ProjectOrion-0.12.12",
  "agents": {
    "core_systems": {
      "description": "Handles core game systems",
      "focus_areas": ["progression", "combat", "character_systems"],
      "priority": "high",
      "estimated_duration_hours": 4
    }
  },
  "coordination": {
    "status_check_interval": 30,
    "log_level": "INFO",
    "auto_restart_failed_agents": true,
    "max_concurrent_agents": 6
  }
}
```

### Monitoring

Each agent creates its own log file:
- `agent_core_systems_log.txt`
- `agent_item_systems_log.txt`
- `agent_world_systems_log.txt`
- etc.

### Status Monitoring

The system provides real-time status updates:
- Progress percentage for each agent
- Completed vs failed tasks
- Current task being worked on
- Overall system status

## Task Distribution Strategy

### Parallel Work Areas

The system is designed to work on completely separate areas to avoid conflicts:

1. **Core Systems** → `scripts/progression/`, `scripts/core/`
2. **Item Systems** → `scripts/crafting/`, `data/items/`
3. **World Systems** → `scripts/world/`, `data/quests/`
4. **Performance** → `scripts/core/`, `scripts/ui/`
5. **Content Creation** → `data/items/`, `data/quests/`, `data/dialogue/`
6. **Testing** → `scripts/testing/`, TestBot integration

### Conflict Avoidance

- Each agent works in different directories
- File-based coordination prevents overwrites
- Stop signals allow graceful shutdown
- Logging tracks all changes

## Benefits

### Efficiency
- **Parallel Development**: 6x faster development with 6 agents
- **Specialized Focus**: Each agent specializes in specific areas
- **Continuous Work**: Agents work for hours without interruption
- **Automated Tasks**: No manual intervention required

### Quality
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All aspects of development covered
- **Specialized Testing**: Dedicated testing agent
- **Documentation**: Automatic documentation updates
- **Bug Prevention**: Dedicated bug fixing agent

### Scalability
- **Easy Expansion**: Add new agents for new areas
- **Configurable**: Adjust priorities and durations
- **Modular**: Each agent operates independently
- **Flexible**: Run specific agents as needed

## Example Workflow

### Morning Setup
```bash
# Start all agents for full development
python start_multi_agents.py --monitor
```

### Midday Check
```bash
# Check progress without stopping
python start_multi_agents.py --status
```

### Evening Review
```bash
# Stop all agents and review results
python start_multi_agents.py --stop
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Task Lists

You can create custom task lists by modifying `create_task_lists()` in `multi_agent_task_system.py`:

```python
def create_custom_tasks():
    return {
        "my_custom_agent": [
            {
                "type": "code_implementation",
                "title": "My Custom Feature",
                "file_path": "scripts/my_feature.gd",
                "code_content": "# Your code here",
                "description": "Implement custom feature"
            }
        ]
    }
```

### Agent Communication

While agents work independently, they can communicate through:
- Shared log files
- Status files
- Configuration updates
- Stop signals

### Error Handling

- Failed tasks are logged and tracked
- Agents continue with next task on failure
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Graceful degradation

## Best Practices

### Agent Selection
- Start with high-priority agents first
- Run complementary agents together
- Monitor resource usage with many agents

### Task Design
- Keep tasks focused and specific
- Provide clear success criteria
- Include proper error handling
- Document task dependencies

### Monitoring
- Check logs regularly for issues
- Monitor progress percentages
- Review completed work quality
- Adjust agent priorities as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Not Starting**
   - Check Python dependencies
   - Verify project path in config
   - Check file permissions

2. **Tasks Failing**
   - Review agent log files
   - Check file paths and permissions
   - Verify task specifications

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Reduce number of concurrent agents
   - Check system resources
   - Monitor memory usage

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in config:
```json
{
  "coordination": {
    "log_level": "DEBUG"
  }
}
```
